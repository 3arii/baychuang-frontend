0,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture )) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2366,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,SQLwitch,1572360722.0,depression
1,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",26,247,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1frqlk0/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/,SQLwitch,1727564743.0,depression

3,I'm going to commit suicide in a few days,"I’m 19 years old and I just can't live like this anymore. I'm so tired of depression and anxiety that I can't see any other way out. I fucking hate myself. Just worthless piece of shit. All the depression, anxiety, loneliness, trauma, financial problems are so exhausting. I don’t enjoy anything, don’t wanna do anything, just feeling sad.
I just want all this pain and suffering to end.

I'm tired of seeing others achieve their dreams while all I do is rotting in bed and trying to stay alive doing nothing. I have no dreams or passions, I’m not good at anything and I don’t even want to do anything. 
I fail at everything I do. 

I will never graduate, I will never get to work because I’m depressed and anxious and I have no energy, I'm just tired all the time. I can't see myself in the future. I have nothing going for me in life, I’m ugly as shit, no marketable skills, no social life (social anxiety), fail at everything.

I have a couple of friends but they don’t really care about my problems. They are living their lives, having fun, doing things. I don’t have energy for anything. I can’t even  remember the last time they asked how I was doing or anything.
My family, especially my mom, are ashamed of me because I’m like this. She doesn’t even try to understand me. She doesn't care or believe in me or that I might get better someday at all. To her I’m just a failure to be ashamed of.
I have tried for so long but I just can’t anymore.


I’m just so tired. Sad. And hopeless.

I have no one or nothing to live for.

I feel so shameful, and although I am not wishing ill will on these people, I still feel anger and hate. I wish my anger would stay as sadness.

5,I haven't left my bed for 6 days,"There has been almost a week that I have no desire to do anything than sleep.The only time I leave my bed is to go to the bathroom.I barely eat or drink any water.When I wake up I immediately want to go to sleep again.Most of the times I end up crying myself to sleep wishing to never wake up again.This is the worst time of my life I can't express how much distress I feel, sometimes with no reason at all I am extremely anxious,I have lost interest at all my hobbies.I have skipped some very important college classes and it doesn't seem to be getting better.

I don't think anyone cares about me in my life and I am starting to believe I will never be loved.I tried to reach out at one of my classmates which I hang out some times but it didn't seem he cared that much because I got no reaction.And I don't blame him why would he?We are not even that close.I am honestly incapable of human communication.

My family doesn't care either because they haven't questioned the fact that I haven't eaten in days or that I always sleep.I obviously can't afford therapy.So this seems like a dead end for me.I don't think there is any hope for me to recover from this.If there is not anyone near me to pull me out from this I don't think I can do something myself.

So if anyone has any advice please tell me because I can't live like this anymore.I know doing small steps helps but I can't even do that.The phrase ""even small victories count"" doesn't give me any motivation at all.I have a weird feeling like this is the final chapter for my life,I can not imagine any future for me good or bad.I wish I had the guts to end my life but I can't even do that.",28,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivmrxk/i_havent_left_my_bed_for_6_days/,Technical_Peace893,1740242259.0,depression

9,Husband won’t seek help,"My husband (30 yo) and I (33 yo) have been together for 14 years, I know well his depression although no one has given him a diagnosis, he has never been treated with a psychologist or a psychiatrist (about 4 years ago I practically forced him and he did not like the approach of that specialist, he only went to one session). 

Recently we were able to enjoy a fairly stable year, he was taking 5-HTP, that same year I got pregnant and when the 6 month pot was running out, he gradually decreased the dose until it stopped completely, everything was going relatively well for a few months, (in the meantime I had postpartum depression, and a baby who did not sleep, it was very difficult for both of us) until he was not, he fell again, strongly, and having now a daughter (1.5 yo now) is very difficult for me to handle, in his lows he gets aggressive, sad and angry... I feel alone, mistreated, even though I know he does his best, when he is doing well, he is managing everything better, homework, taking care of our daughter, the occasional outing, I see him making an effort... But he doesn't want to see a psychologist or psychiatrist, he doesn't want to do couples therapy, he doesn't want to take 5-HTP again because he tried it once and felt worse, he doesn't want to go out to do sports…

I don't want to continue in this situation, the lows are so, so painfuI. I know that leaving is an option, but what else can I do?",6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivtl06/husband_wont_seek_help/,Puzzled-Kitchen-5236,1740259707.0,depression

11,“Girl I've realised life's too short to be depressed!”,"“Need to look forward to the future!”

What my best friend responded with after I hinted about being depressed recently. I’ve been diagnosed with depression since 18 years old. I’ve had symptoms since I was 11. I’m 26 now. I’ve gone through phases and episodes. Whenever I go through a depression episode I just keep it to myself. I’ve learnt the hard way that people who’ve never experienced clinical depression will never understand. It’s pointless to even let them know how you feel. Yeah let me just erase all the trauma I’ve gone through. My abusive childhood, emotionally & sexually abusive manipulative relationship with one of the most narcissistic men I’ve met that I got out 7 months ago. The relationship left me traumatised and crying my eyes out to this day! 

Let me erase the fact that I’m working a shit job in retail that I despise. Let me forget the fact that I’m still living with my abusive parents. Ffs! It’s hard for me to even get out of bed. I have to drag myself out to go to work and even then I’m usually late. Hard to bother to shower. Hard to do my laundry, hard to clean my room. Haven’t washed my hair in a month… on my days off I either rot in my bed scrolling on my phone or smoke weed. 

Why are people so damn confident in being ignorant! Like wtf? It’s just frustrating. Depression is a medical condition. On one hand I understand that ignorance is bliss. The majority of society says to speak up if you’re going through anything. Yet will give the most blanket dismissive feel good statements in the moment.

You can look forward to the future and still be depressed about your past  and current life circumstances. I would never say something like this if someone was going through something. I’d be understanding, open to hearing and supportive the whole way through! People literally kill themselves over depression. 

Not only have I been diagnosed with depression, I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. Making things worse. ",8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivpu9v/girl_ive_realised_lifes_too_short_to_be_depressed/,blacmsoul,1740249915.0,depression

Long story short I can't control my emotions and get frustrated/stressed far too easily and snap at small things.

I miss her so much, and I hope she misses me, but I can easily see her already being over it all and getting on with her life. She was a great person, and I obviously wish her no ill, but it hurts so much to imagine her already past this and laughing and having a great time with her many other friends when I'm at rock bottom.

16,I'm sorry for the child you have,"Just a vent to my parents, they know a lot of this, but I don't think I could ever really share my deeper thoughts with them verbatim. I just need to get this off my chest and maybe hear what people need to tell me, because I don't know what to do anymore, all I feel like I can do is just keep existing.

I know I'm in the wrong, and I'm truly sorry that you have to live and be around someone like me who can't even give you the courtesy of openly enjoying your company. I'm just not the same anymore Mom and Dad, nor do I want to be and I wish you could understand and respect that. You both know I'm sick mentally, not that that is an excuse, but I haven't been the same since my ex left, but even before I met him and I was off to college to finally work on what I thought would be the beginning to my new life, I was well over having to abide by the rules and expectations underneath your roof. Call it teenage angst, but I had been sick of having to continue to mentally live under the will of a teenager and be okay with you both involved in all my private and personal matters. I know in everything that you do and have done has been carried out with genuine, loving intent, but I have been well ready to start growing up, to seek my own path in life, and most importantly begin my life with someone who I thought would want to share it with me. I thought leaving for college meant it was finally my chance. 

I met someone, fell in love, and I don't think I've ever loved someone quite the same way that I loved this man. For a time life was perfect, I thought everything was falling into place. We still had our issues, but I thought that I found the man that I was ready to spend my life with, one day at a time - until he couldn't take me anymore. With turmoil after turmoil, he finally left, and I ended the semester as a broken person. My academic and occupational ambitions no longer mean anything to me. I've always had the idea to go into social work because I have to do something with my life, I had to make you guys proud, and I thought maybe through this therapeutic approach I could give back to others somehow. But truthfully I've never been *excited* to have a career, I don't think most people do realistically, to have to spend their life slaving away at a job just to survive. But I thought not only was I going to give back with my career, but I'd be able to use it to support both myself and the man that I so desperately loved long before I even knew him, just for it all to come crashing to pieces, and since desperately trying for love, again and again, I really just don't have that spark for it anymore.

I've always been lazy, a procrastinator, and still am to this day, unfortunately. I always felt disappointed in who I was, I've almost always done the bare minimum but it had been just enough to get through school with good grades and a promising future. But now I really don't even want a future anymore, so it's hard to pretend I care about anything that I do nowadays. Yet I'm back in school to finish that class I failed after my breakup, and I find that I still have little to no motivation to do any of the work, but I do it because I know it's the right thing to do by you both instead of doing nothing most days. I don't care about the subject, I find myself dreading going to school, and I fear the potential for failure yet *AGAIN*. I can't do this to you guys, I don't want to continue to let you both down, but how much can I do at this point if I no longer wish to do anything? Still, I carry on, in academics and in living, just to appease you both.

I hate living here. I don't want to be ungrateful, frankly, I think of myself like a spoiled pig; all I do most days is eat your food, sleep under your roof, use up your water and electricity, isolate as much as I can, and spend my and your own money on frivolous and stupid things that I want just to try and feel something. I need a job, I do not want a job, I do not nor do I feel capable of mentally being around others in a work environment, but I understand that I have to do something. I know it's wrong and it's eating away at me that I use material possessions to cope with my depression and loneliness, so at least if I can work for it that can take some pressure off your backs. But I've only applied for one job so far and haven't heard back, I need to do more, but I also need to give more of a damn and stop being so lazy and selfish when I prefer to scroll through social media all day or go thrift shopping just to distract my mind from the reality of my life.

  
I hate that I cause you guys so much grief and keep you wondering what's wrong with me; if you did anything wrong. I have told you on multiple occasions now that no, you have done nothing wrong, and I mean this truly. While I do find you both to be a bit overprotective, I know your intentions are well-meaning, and you've given me a privileged life with more than I could ever deserve. But I wish the depression for which I struggle with every day could be a problem of my own - I neither want to burden you nor do I want you to feel obligated to object yourself into my personal struggles. You will always be my parents, I will always love you, but I need to live my own life too where you guys don't feel the need to object yourself into all my personal matters, both positive and negative. When I am ready and if I am ready, I do want you to be a part of my life and the things I do, but not now, not in the way that you are trying to make my problems yours.

You say I need family in my life, you try to apply your beliefs on depression and loss to that of my own without my wanting to, and while I know you are simply doing your best to care for me, this is not what I am asking for. Ungratefully, selfishly, in my grief and loneliness, it is simply just not enough. I've been in two new relationships since my ex left me, relationships you do not know about because I have no desire to involve you in my personal life anymore. I'm sorry that I cannot share these things with you, but I just can't take it anymore - having to include my Mom and Dad in every little decision I make for myself is exhausting. I continue to be locked in that teenage state of being feeling that I can only make so many choices for myself without your involvement in them. I don't even want you involved in the little tidbits that I share in my therapy, but I know it would be wrong otherwise and if it can hopefully lessen your worries, and not keep you so far in the dark, I will continue to share what I feel comfortable with just to make you happy. The biggest thing I yearn for in my life is that I crave romantic, intimate love. I crave a partner to grow young with, to spend my days with, to mature and experience life together with, but even at this point, I have grown empty and hopeless. I still, desperately, wish for love and companionship every day, but after this point what can I do? I feel unlovable, unwanted, broken. I truly think that there is something wrong with me that is driving men away, that they cannot handle my excessive needs or emotional behavior. I don't want to be a lot, I really try not to, I try to give others their time and space as needed and I never want to be someone's problem/burden, but regardless it all ends the same way, and what I'm left with is to go back to my childhood home as a near 24-year old adult, not looking forward to returning to a loving place with just my partner and I but to my overprotective parents who I can't even make eye contact with anymore.

I love you Mom and Dad, none of this is your fault, you have done nothing wrong. Simply put, I just want to be alone. I don't want to be here anymore, I don't want to live under your roof and your rules but what choice do I have? I am a broke, jobless, hopeless loser. I want to kms every day but I continue to drag myself like a corpse just so you both will never have to go through the grief and loss of losing a child. I want to be in love but at this point, I'm beginning to accept that I am just inherently wrong, and that love will struggle to find me because, in a dramatic sense, I am broken. So without love, I have no desire to build a career or live a full life. It may not be the healthy way to think, but it's simply my belief, and I can't just be okay with being alone and living by myself anymore. It's been the same story again and again in my life, and even when I was so sure that I found my partner, it was all for nothing in the end. I'm tired of going from man to man, yet I have so much of myself that I want to give that I know I will continue to do so and grieve every new loss that comes my way at this point. I am so numb, I am truly, without exaggeration, a burden to your home. I am uncomfortable being around or even talking to you both anymore; I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be acknowledged, I want to be as though I'm not even there. I do barely any chores for the house, I leave clutter wherever I go, and I do so little to provide for this household I'm surprised you both haven't kicked me into the street yet and forced me to figure out what to do with myself, I really think that's what I've earned at this point. I know you are biting your tongues every day around me for fear of hurting my feelings, it is a kindness I do not deserve and it is an excruciating burden that you continue to experience without intention. I've never felt good about being your child, truthfully I've always felt you deserved better since at least high school, but here I am. Because you both love so much and care so deeply, you continue to feed me, clothe me, and buy me nearly anything I might ask for because I will always, unfortunately, be your child.

  
I am so sorry that I am not more, that I no longer care to be more. I am just drifting, trying to get by day by day and do what's expected of me, but even then I can barely accomplish that. You both deserve better, you deserve love, respect, and acknowledgment that you are good parents and people to others like me who don't even deserve it.

19,I'm reminded of how I'm not a good person in any aspect 24/7.,"I'm a plague on people. I keep making people waste money on me, I hurt everyone I care about, and I don't have anything of value to show for 18 years. Is it just me that thinks that maybe I'm a worthless pos? Even when doing things with family and being generally happy, I can't enjoy inside because something will remind me of how shitty of a person I am. It happened yesterday. I was at the pool with family and it was all good. Eventually I got into the hot tub and got relaxed. And everything rushed back and hit me in the face. And I spent the rest of the day thinking about it well into the night. I couldn't even interact with people because I was non stop thinking that I'm a shitty person. I thought about cutting myself up with the knife in the kitchen last night. And then I thought about how I should have hung myself from my bedroom window a few months ago when I was close to attempting it. Because then at least i wouldn't be a problem now. I hate myself. I'm a shit person and I want to kill myself. I was clean of sh for months. Then less than a month ago, I took a rock to my arm. I keep itching to do it again. I should have my brain blown out.

20,As I get older things just get progressively worse.,"When I say I've struggled for years, I mean I've struggled with depression with psychosis since I was around 8 years old. Even though I have supportive people around me, I still am miserable. It doesn't even matter if there's something good happening in my life, I'm always miserable.

I feel as though, that since I am now older, I carry things with me that just repeat inside my head over and over again from when I was younger, and I just dwell over it and cry over it. My sleep schedule has been a mess it never stays in one perfect pattern. 

I am up all night way past almost 5am crying, every night. I hate that it impacts the people around me, it makes me feel like I'm some sort of monster. Now needless to say I do go to therapy I do have resources and I do get help, and along with struggling since I was 8 Ive been in therapy since that age too, and I had gotten put on medications. 

No, I am not on medications now, because of many different reasons because depression is not my only mental illness I have but it's one that definitely impacts me a lot. I feel like as life goes on for me, I just get more and more depressed. 

As of lately I've had things that have also been sparking my depression more than ever, and I think that could be apart of it also. I just hope at some point in my life I can find some sort of peace from everything, and I don't mean by suicide or any of those sorts. I've attempted so many times before I've SH before and it never seems to work out, so at this point I just want just some type of peace, where not everyday I'm very irritable and depressed.",15,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivh6rj/as_i_get_older_things_just_get_progressively_worse/,ResearcherSubject147,1740225576.0,depression

I broke up with my first (and probably last) girlfriend because she didn't love me anymore, i was probably too shy to form a connection with her, even tho i loved her so much and i have to admit i still like her now, even though we stopped talking. Now every day feels the same: i try to get decent grades at school, even though i'm not interested in what i learn; i fail to ""love myself"", to the point when i barely apply basic hygiene just so people don't think that i stink; i keep falling in love with girls at my school, and lose feelings a month after. Suicide/self harm is not an option for me because it scares me and i'd feel too guilty for the people that actually care about me. Whenever I'm not distracted by video games, my mind gets assaulted by depressing thoughts about me, my ""life"" and my last relationship.

33,I'm thinking of giving up,"I am 26F and I am giving up. I don't want to try anymore and I genuinely feel okay with it but if I choose to do this thing that I really want, I would torture my mother with sorrow. 

I think I've experienced enough and I just want to be done with it. I have dreams but I don't want to do it and I feel at peace with it. I've felt love.. I've been in love and I was also loved. I've had pain and have caused pain. I think I also had some fun and I had a lot of fears. I still do. I fear the process of death but I don't think I fear death itself. I still don't know how I'm going to do it. I read somewhere that women tend to prefer ways of doing it with the least pain. I think that's true for me too.

I am selfish, I know and understand that. But I am also still selfish eitherway. If I continue to choose to live, I can't see how I'm going to enjoy life other than lay around and do absolutely nothing. My loved ones will only watch me wither away as I force myself to stay here. I'd watch everyone around me be dissappointed, they'll pity and resent me. I'll be a waste of money and time. I'll either be a nobody living in my parents house till the day I die or I'll become homeless and die. Depending on what my family would do with my cold-heartless self. I'll break their hearts every single day because I will remind them how much I hate existing and I'll lose myself and I'll lose them eventually too. That's just how life goes. It is exhausting to live with someone who simply doesn't want to live. This is the torture I'll be putting up with the people around me should I choose to live. 

It's all the same no matter what if I choose to live or die. I don't want to try anymore and I feel at peace with it.

I am depressed.. but I also don't want to be better. What for do I want to be better? For other people? For myself? For my family? For work? For love? 
I sound so nihilistic but I really can't see it any other way. I just don't want to bother or be a burden to other people. I don't want to compete with anyone just to live better. I don't want to cause anyone any more pain and suffering and I don't want it too. I will hurt my mother either way. 
I'm just choosing the least amount of person to suffer with my loss. I'll ask for forgiveness. It is the only thing that I can do. 

Maybe I am wrong to see life this way.

40,Changing meds,"Can anyone offer advice on a complete change of medication and what I’ll go through?
I’m on Prozac and normally they take around ten days to kick in properly and there’s the big dip during that period where your brain chemistry struggles to keep up. 

Anyway, this time around they don’t seem to be working as well as they usually do for me, I’ve been taking a decent dose for over three weeks now, which was increased from a smaller dose I’ve been on for about five months. I’ve told all my friends they’re doing the trick, but they’re not. 
A couple of times over the last month I had really strong suicidal urges, but they were ‘pit of despair’ moments where in that specific moment I couldn’t see an alternative and felt that was my only option, but both times something happened to delay me and those short delays made me pause and ultimately come down, once by myself and once because I was talking to someone. 

So my worry is that I think I need to change meds and try something else, but my suicidal thoughts now are different, they’re just because I’m drained and can’t do this any more, so I don’t think I could cope with starting from scratch. 
I’ve had chronic passive suicidal ideation lots of times over the years but it just feels like I’ve resigned myself to it this time. I just can’t take any more hits, I feel punch drunk and finishing things would be a blessed relief. 
So if I go back to the doc and change will I actually be starting from scratch and have to try to cope with the initial dip again or will there be a residual effect while I come off the Prozac? 

I’d appreciate some sort of idea what I’ll go through. ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivuffc/changing_meds/,employismuswashhans,1740262013.0,depression

44,Not wearing makeup helps my mental health,"Hello, so I just really need to get this off my chest. I was in a wedding today and I did my own makeup and a friend did my hair. The wedding was beautiful and the bride and groom were amazing truly in love with each other and everyone was super happy and excited for them. 

At the reception I had a few people come up and compliment my hair and makeup. I said thank you and a few people (who have made comments like this in the past) suggested I do this more often and I would definitely attract a man if I did this. 

For some context I have struggled since my early teens to love myself and even went through some really dark times where I hated my body and everything about me. I am 24 now and have been in the slow process of healing from some of that so I when I was 19 stopped wearing makeup as often because I wanted to start to love that girl in the mirror for exactly how she was made. 

I just personally have gotten to the point in my life where wearing makeup doesn’t feel like the right thing for me at this time in healing. I know I should just ignore it. It is just very frustrating. It also doesn’t really help that a good chunk of people I go to church with are very much looking for mates and dating is a constant conversation. I have been single for a while now and have peace with it, but I still ave people trying to shove dating and makeup and spending 2 hours every morning to get read to be good enough for the next man walking down the street so I can finally be married. 

I just wish these single women would stop trying to shove their opinions of how I should look and act and talk and walk and what I should wear and what I should say or shouldn’t say down my throat. I find it so very frustrating!

I don’t feel comfortable explaining my story to these people and I do know how to use makeup and I am not personally against. I have just found that not wearing it forced me to face the girl in the mirror. I guess I am asking if I am wrong for feeling this way?

47,sigh.,"i joined this community to rant about my life and how suicidal i was but people here have bigger problems. i think now i can deal with whatever i am going throught i have stopped the self pity maybe you should too. .ik you don't feel like doing anything when you are depressed you only feel like lying on your bed but you have food to eat you have a place to live, some people don't even get these and yet they are trying to survive somehow. why not try doing the little things like bath as you wake up, clean your room little by little start doing your chores, join gym or start working out at home? or if you are a student start by reading chapter 1 of any subject you find easy. its never too late to start anything if you are a failure now that's totally fine. move on. start searching for another opportunity. i am an indian and i can't even show that i am depressed i can't just lie on my bed cz either my mom or dad will beat the shit outta me. they don't even know i have a scar which was made when i tried to commit sui cide. i don't blame them ,its bcz i never opened up to them so how would they know. i  have accepted thats how majority of the indian parents are i have stopped blaming them and the self pity. i hope y'all will accept everything that has happened to you as a part of life and move forward",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivohie/sigh/,unsable002,1740246506.0,depression

51,Little Rat,About 3 days ago I noticed a small rat unable to walk normally in the middle of the parking lot. It kept losing it's balance while walking aimlessly so I thought it was dying or injured. I hesitated to help it at first until a curious crow flew next to it and started pecking at it. I got out of my car and the crow flew away. I proceeded to get a small rag and stuffed it in a little cardboard box and gently encouraged the creature into said box. It immediately tucked itself into the furthest corner of the box and I hid it in a wooded area nearby. I went to check the box today knowing I was going to find the rat dead inside but to my surprise it was empty and there was no sign of the rat. I had it in my head that if I saw the rat dead that I would go back inside and put a bullet in my head. Decades ago my first partner said to me while I was feeling vulnerable and tucked into the furthest corner of the bed that I reminded her of a cowardly & pathetic rat. Anyways I am hoping the rat is ok.,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivt8x4/little_rat/,-ImaginaryFriend-,1740258815.0,depression

Is a depressed person really sad to the point of suicide **every single day of their lives**? Probably not. 

Maybe they in fact are! But for most of us, probably not! We get days and even weeks where we are in a decent mindset and feel good and not doom and gloom. 

But one **bad life experience, one traumatic moment, one bad conversation**, and we feel the weight of our depression once again!! 

It comes back and it hurts and we are sad again. It's an **illness** for crying out loud.

54,i think i'm just fucked,"I'm a 17-year-old in a good area with both parents, warm food on the table, a roof over my head, and many luxuries. I have never struggled with physical illness, poverty, intense bullying, or anything of the sort. At most, I'm depressed and anxious but boohoo - so what? Most people are, and I'm fortunate enough to be both diagnosed and medicated for it. I am extremely well-off, more so than anyone else in my family ever was at my age.

Yet, despite all of this, I am still a complete failure. I have everything to succeed, with nothing to discourage or stop me, and yet I just don't. I am at risk of not graduating highschool, have made little-to-no attempt to obtain a job or license, and I have no plan for the future despite the dreams I had as a child. 

Naturally, I am quite intelligent - both in general and in an emotional sense. If I applied myself, school would be a breeze. 

Instead, school stresses me out so much that I find any excuse to avoid it. I purposefully try to make myself fall ill in order to stay home (sleeping w/ my window open during the rain, eating expired food, withdrawling from medication). I constantly feel nauseous at the idea of seeing/speaking to teachers or checking my grades. So on.

My life is as easy as it's ever going to be right now, and yet I can't push myself to work any harder. If I don't graduate, my parents will kick me out. I have no money to go to college, which means I will be taken off of my parent's health insurance when I turn of age. 

If I'm already doomed, if I'm already a kind of person that could never survive in the real world, why go on? Is it okay to give up",27,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1iv9a8t/i_think_im_just_fucked/,CloudyPOPPED,1740194312.0,depression

56,I should love my life but I hate it,"I am a 23F who is considered a ""failure to launch"". I was diagnosed with depression when I was 15. Even with my mental health struggles, I was top of my class straight A student who was always told that I ""had so much going"" for me. My parents are extremely loving and supportive. They started a college fund when I was born, and since I was able to get half of my tuition paid for in scholarships, I did not have to go into debt to get my degrees. I worked three jobs while I was in college, but not because I HAD to, only because I WANTED to and enjoyed those jobs. After I graduated, I Immediately got a full-time job and moved back in with my parents so i could save money for graduate school. I worked full time for a year and started graduate school with the leftover money i had in my college fund account. I am continuing to work a full time job with benefits while I go to grad school as a full time student. i never had to worry about food, i never had to worry about housing, and i always had clothes. the only hardship i have ever faced was my mom and her terminal illness that she was diagnosed with when i was 15. i have literally hit the jackpot in life......and im miserable.

i live with my parents because i still dont make enough to live on my own where i am from. i dont have kids, i dont have a partner, and i can save most of my paychecks since i dont pay to live yet. my parents won't let me pay for rent and car payments- they say  i can't because im still in school- the school they are paying for. i should literally love my life. yet i hate it. i dont want to wake up in the morning. i dont want to grow older. i want it to end pretty much everyday. i resent my parents for supporting me because i dont deserve it. ive done nothing to help society in anyway, i dont deserve the life i have. im a leech who has nothing going for her. i have all these resources and i still cant live without my parents. i still cant find love. everyone around me has achieved greater with so much less given to them . i wish my parents would let me go. i wish they would let me suffer. i should be so grateful for everything that has been given to me but all i am is sad. pills and therapy help, and then im right back to sad. my default is sad. i cant admit any of this out loud without sounding ungrateful. I know i sound like a spoiled brat. i know i sound like a loser. its why i hate myself much. because no matter how good my life is, i can only ever be sad. 

i know that no one is going to sympathize or empathize with my situation because my whole life has been handed to me on a silver platter. i have nothing to complain or be sad about. thats the worst part about depression.

66,"Friend is struggling and I want to help, but it’s affecting me aswell","My close friend is struggling really bad with depression, I am her only friend and it is causing me anxiety

I’ve (F27) been friends with J (F27) since we were teenagers. She had a very traumatic experience in her childhood (something that her father did) which has caused her severe anxiety and depression. 

She used to be very close to her mom and siblings, but they won’t take her side on this trauma, which has led to her pretty much cutting them off. 

I am the only friend of hers, apart from some work colleagues which she doesn’t spend time with outside of work. No partner and no other family members. She sees a therapist once a week and has been on medication for years, which has helped slightly. Sometimes her mental health is a bit better and sometimes it gets worse again.

Well, now she is mentally in a very bad state, and whenever she messages me how shitty she feels and doesn’t have any will to live anymore, I try to support her as much as I can. I tell her she is important, she matters, that I am here for her, and offer to meet her etc. But since I am a very sensitive person, my mind starts spiralling and I can’t think of anything else than worry about her, I feel responsible of helping her because she has nobody else, and it’s making me very anxious. 

I don’t know what to do. I have my own life: husband, other friends, family, work and hobbies. I feel so bad for feeling like this, I have it so easy compared to her. But it’s taking a toll on me, to get all that emotional load to carry with her. Sometimes it feels so hopeless - just when she starts doing better, it suddenly gets worse again. I just want her to be happy.

What more should I do to help her? And what can I do to prevent this from effecting my own mental health? I would love to hear if anyone has been in a similar situation.

A beautiful girlfriend who I've loved with for almost three years. Three cars. A stable job.  I look back to how I used to be and how I acted and I know I no longer can feel that way.

 I don't want to do anything anymore. I tell myself just how easy it would be to do it. But I can't. The only thing I can do is eat, sleep and repeat. My mind tried to sabotage my relationship. My mind tries to sabotage itself. Why? I have no reason 

 I have random bursts where I can feel happy but it quickly dissipates. I can't focus on things anymore like work or even if I watch TV. My mind randomly starts working itself to death. I try to fight it. I'm so exhausted. Half of the time I can't even remember what I'm sad about.
I feel cold a lot. Tingles in my face. Fingers. Legs. I don't recognize anything anymore. I feel like I'm just here. 

I'm about to turn 25. It feels like I'm just counting the days down before I can rest. Truthfully? I don't really want it. I just want the peace that comes with it. To no longer feel this way. It feels like I battle I can't win, because it always comes back.

I can't get psychiatry help to get evaluated. No one ever replies. Doctor gives referrals but no one reaches out to me. I already had therapy. I try breathing. I try ignoring it and just live my life. But I can't. I resulted to Hims as a final resort to get me prescribed Fluoextine 20mg (Prozac). I don't know what else to do.

82,MDD & Marriage,"Throw away account. I've been majorly depressed since 12 and have cPTSD & BPD. No medication or therapy I've tried has worked. I was forced to give birth at 17 (SA), abandoned completely by my parents. When I left my first ex I lost custody because I'm incapable of keeping any sort of income for long. He was basically never home after school and he believed my depression was fake. My postpartum went untreated for 3 years because I had 0 support & his family had loads of money to dump into attorneys. My diagnosis is chronic and resistant to medication.
My husband and I have been together for 7 years. He saved me from my last relationship. I have a 5 year old with him.
I have been a stay at home mom since my second was born as I've been unable to keep income & it wasn't worth daycare costs. I have not had much income my whole life because of my anxiety/depression. I don't have a work history as a result of my condition and do not qualify for SSDI or SSI.
Now that our son is in Kindergarten I've been trying to find something I can do to make some sort of money as it's clear my disability has taken a toll on my husband. He provides everything and feels like he doesn't get much back.
He recently got a huge pay increase. We went from 28k a year to 75k. There were times I had to heat up water on a fire so we could bathe but now I'm using him??
Now he says my depression is too much for him. That I'm manipulative, abusive, using him for his money. I genuinely do not understand when he started feeling this way because before all of our conversations surrounding my depression were of mutual love and understanding. I hardly raise my voice and I always take care of myself on my worst days. Maybe once a year I get bad enough where I cannot leave the house/my room for a month or so. But past that I take care of everything despite how sick I constantly feel.
I feel like I'm not worth anything to anyone. I try so hard every single day to take my medication, exercise and not off myself when I'm in a low. Therapy doesn't help. I've tried 36 combinations of medications in the last decade. It will not go away and I feel like no one believes me. Part of me thinks I'm not even mentally ill. My body hurts physically constantly. I'm burned out from being alive and I haven't met a doctor yet here in bum fuck nowhere that will look past my mental health and weight. Maybe it can't be treated because something else is wrong?
I don't like my life. I don't like myself. I'm doing EVERYTHING I CAN to pull myself up and I can't. It's not an excuse it's reality.
All of a sudden I'm manipulative, controlling and a liar. Last night I forgot my phone in my coat pocket and grabbed it from the couch & forgot to turn off the light in that room when I went to sleep. This morning I woke up to being accused of sneaking out!!!
I'm faithful, loving and supportive. I manage the entire house. Literally all this man has to do is go to work. He does NOTHING at home unless I'm in a low week, and even then he doesn't help me around the house. It's always up to me to get things done or I'm blamed for the mess he helps make.. 
I feel like instead of admitting he resents me for being disabled from depression he's taking it out on me. Every single fight for the last year has been excruciating trying to explain to him I'm not purposely neglecting myself.
I take medication! I exercise! I still vomit from anxiety when I leave the house.  My body hurts so bad it's hard to move sometimes. I guess I'm here venting because when he leaves I'm done with life. I can't support myself and I refuse to be dependent again.
I'm tired of the ""try this! You're not doing enough! It's a mindset!"" I simply cannot do this anymore.

I'm defeated, I lost my job of five years back in September. I was wrongfully terminated but that left me in a financial rut that I'm just now digging myself out of. I'm a widow, three kids all together. Just attempting to survive on my meager new salary. I had a great job, besides the stress. It paid well, I was given decent benefits and now it's starting over as a newbie in a company that I have to earn all that I had once back. I have no one else to ask for help because I've exhausted all my means months ago when I was even more desperate than I am now. I know that people are sick of me being in the situation I am but I've been trying SO HARD to make it. To not need anyone unless absolutely necessary and I just hate how I've been made to feel like a burden by those who are supposed to love me the most.

84,“Work on yourself” Why?,"This is going to be a bit of a depressive rant; I’m in my own head again and i just need to get it out

always hate this kind of toxic positivity. All the time people are like just work on yourself bro, it gets better and it’s the most ignorant crap I’ve ever heard. Why would I do this; tell me what the reward is? So I can sit here, lonely and rot as a better looking meat sack with a bit more money which still doesn’t cover living properly? Is that my reward? Scraping by eating stuff I don’t like to maintain this fleshbag of a body that looks slightly better. You can’t fix your face…

Beyond work I don’t do anything. I don’t have any friends; only acquaintances that I talk to on occasion and a rift has come between them so now there are two halves and one I don’t even speak to anymore… I don’t know anyone IRL except family or work and all previous colleagues won’t speak to me

I don’t have a girlfriend or anything and haven’t done so for 12 years; not even a casual thing. I’m out of shape, I’ve got an ugly head, and I don’t care enough to change it for reasons above; so I can rot on my own and go “yay I moved out finally at 30 but I can only afford 2 minute noodles every second day for dinner because rent takes up my whole wage for the week”

If I lived on my own I’d have killed myself years ago. I’m only here because I don’t want to hurt my grandparents otherwise I’m looking to get out. What kind of life is this man… even if I change it and get better employment and eat right and move out etc I’m still going to be a lonely piece of trash anyway I may as well try and enjoy the food I’m eating at a minimum….probably the only thing I do enjoy these days really…

87,I feel like there's not much to live for anymore.,"Hi everyone,

This post wasn't easy to write. I feel immensely overwhelmed and depressed with how the past few months have been and what the future holds for me.

I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years. We've had a fair share of fights and misunderstandings. Lately, we've had problems with our sex life. I'm not going to go into detail too much because it doesn't matter. Last week, after sex, she told me ""jokingly"" that she doesn't feel the same intimacy and ""butterflies"" like she did before. I don't blame her, it definitely has to do with me aswell but still, it broke me completely. After that we had a fight and we didn't solve the sex thing because she said she doesn't know how to fix it. Out of panic and sadness, I resulted to going to certain NSFW subreddits of celebrities and did the thing. She took my phone today without me knowing and went through my Reddit history and found out. I didn't excuse my actions at all, I shouldn't have done it, it was completely wrong. She cried, she's very disappointed in me and told me that I haven't changed (for backstory, I was very lustful in my teenage years before her). I tried to explain why I did what I did but I kept reminding her that it's not an excuse, I don't know why I do what I do. She hasn't talked to me since and I'm not sure what's going to happen now. If she stays, I'm willing to accept that I need to regain her trust. GF, If you're reading this, I'm truly so sorry for what I've done.

After I moved out last summer, my dad cheated on my mom after 30 years of marriage. My dad is acting like a complete asshole, visiting the woman while not wanting my mom to move out. He should move out but he refuses, my mom is too attached to move aswell. My dad completely broke our family, no one talks to him anymore except me. There will never be a time where we can be a happy family again. They will never be together to see me marry, to see me graduate, to see my kids - never, it's all gone. It has killed my soul.

Today, my mom told me she has breast cancer and she doesn't know if it's a ""good"" or ""bad"" cancer yet. I can't lose my mom, I just can't after all that's happened this year.

I was supposed to have some friends over today but they cancelled last minute, now I'm all alone with my beers feeling completely nothing. I hoped I could get away from this shit and all these thoughts for a night.

On top of it all, I got diagnosed with a bunch of life long diseases. I might not live past 50. I've suffered from ADHD, anxiety and depression all my life. I hate everyone, I hate doing everything I used to love and I wish I was a better person. I have these thoughts every god damn day, they don't stop and it's killing me. Everyone's told me that I'm like a zombie, I don't want to talk, I don't want to do anything. I can't sleep properly, I have nightmares every single night. I wake up trying to breath with tears in my eyes. I'm currently tearing up writing this, I feel like I'm a horrible person and there's no way that I will be able to overcome all of this. I'm extremely embarrased and sad for doing what I did to my girlfriend, I'm hopeless because my family is broken and my mom has health issues, I feel nothing anymore because all I do is fuck everything up.

Thank you if you made it this far.

While one might consider this ""freeing"", I find it paralyzing, so many possibilities, I don't know myself, and I'm 16, I can't help it but feel like the only way for me to refrain from attempting again is if I somehow turn my life upside down before my whole future is decided before me, but why can't I just live without any requirements, I feel overwhelmed, and I'm alone, relationships has become more of a burden for me, and I can never feel genuine connection, I'm just scared, even if not from death, but from living, I had a purpose when I sought suicidal ideation, I felt like I was born to die, and death being the only absolute there is, I still felt fulfilled even through all the emptiness and despair, but to continue living is like trying to find ways to justify living

92,having slow cognition and a lame personality,"I feel like my job contributes to my feelings of inadequacy. In every interaction I am a subordinate, the newbie who needs to be able to laugh at himself and take tough criticism day in and day out. However, I have such low self-esteem and such a difficult time learning on the fly (not to mention actually remembering what I’ve learned) that I am frustrated and embarrassed every single day at work. I hate the way I’m too slow to banter with customers and too boring to be liked by my coworkers. Even in the scant free time I have away from this job, I am regarded lowly and ignored. My brother looks down on and criticizes me, while even my dad wants less to do with me than him. My mom respects him more as well. My best friend doesn’t even respond to my quips or comments sometimes, she’s so disinterested. I try to let my natural personality shine through, but afterward I realize that what I say without a filter is boring or annoying most of the time. I don’t have the magnetic personality that I always wished to have and admired to no end. I am not an interesting, funny, or exciting person and no matter how much I attempt to improve my personality, that much is ingrained in my being. Talking more has not helped me become more likeable, so maybe the key to being more likeable is to talk less instead. My personality is pretty bad, so people tend to like me better when I show less of it. Better to be the mysterious yet lonely quiet person rather than the known and ridiculed talkative person. In neither scenario am I truly happy, though. I can’t help thinking the certain rejection by the masses might be worth it to have a couple more friends who tolerate me. Then again, it may turn out that truly no one likes me and I will be irrevocably crushed by that certainty. I wish I was witty, excitable, creative, and cool. Instead I just come off as desperate when I try to be liked and annoying when I don’t. It doesn’t seem like there’s any way to just be better, because I’ve tried improving my personality for so long with scarcely anything to show for it. I fundamentally dislike myself, so how can I expect anyone else to like me? I can’t CBT my way into thinking differently, I simply wish I had traits that I do not have, no matter how hard I have tried to acquire them. If I cannot improve and I cannot accept myself as I am, then I am a hopeless case. People might love or care for me abstractly, but they do not enjoy me as I enjoy them. No one really cares about me, not personally anyway. No one would care if I was gone, not like they’d be missing out on anything by not having me there. Disliked by everyone, including myself.

I have realized through my interactions with people that my lack of quick wit and emotional expression makes my personality thoroughly boring and unremarkable to interact with. This realization has helped me to understand why my previous girlfriends were very attracted to me on an aesthetic level, but grew less interested in talking to me the longer the relationship progressed. I have nothing to offer beyond gifts, services, and my looks. No one has ever truly been attracted to my personality, even when it comes to friendships. My one good, lasting friendship I still have is built on my acceptance of her personality, not any interest in mine. When I try to voice my opinions, tell my stories, or crack my jokes, she is not very interested and does not ask follow-up questions. Friends and partners never really enjoy my personality and prefer the company of their other friends most of the time. This is despite me trying for years now to make myself interesting and fun to talk with. It has not worked at all beyond some superficial social skills, so my lame personality remains unchanged. I feel that it is pointless to try and make friends when nearly everyone ignores me, and dating would only lead to a superficial attraction at best, which would fizzle out as they got to know my boring self. Yet, if I don’t at least try, then this loneliness becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

94,I'm terrified of forever being alone.,"Mind you, the concept and practice of loneliness is not something foreign. Growing up as an overweight   , depressed autistic woman meant that I would always eat lunch alone and be singled out from friend groups. I would yearn for love while everyone else had a special someone. So being alone is not something new. However, a blunt epiphany occurred that straight up broke me.

I started watching a romance drama where the two main leads loved each other deeply. The way how they cared for each other, and loved each other with such passion and devotion. I know, I know, ""Why are you comparing real life to staged adoration?"" However, I couldn't ignore the fact that all flaws of the other person were melted with thoughts of adoration and complete yearning. As I started to remember all the real life couples that act this way, loving with complete unconditionality, my heart ultimately broke. I became emotionally shattered with the thought that in my 22 years of life, I have never been wanted. Not socially, not romantically, not even lustfully. I have never experienced pure want and a sense of unfiltered need at the hands of my peers. And it hurts. It hurts to be single in all aspects of my life. It hurts to wake up every morning alone, and have work be the one time I socialize with humanity. It hurts that I've never been flirted with, never been taken on a proper date, never passionately kissed, not even passionately fucked. It hurts that I've never naturally been said ""Happy Birthday!"" without me having to casually mention it. It hurts to be blatantly treated like nothing while others get treated like basic human beings. I know love and friendship isn't always hearts and giggles, but the simple act of being loved with most ardent wanting is something that I yearn deeply.

And yes, one could say that 22 is still young in the grand scheme of life, and that I still have so much before me to experience. But living these 22 years without someone to call my best friend, my lover, my rock, is something that fundamentally shatters my heart and soul. It suffocates me from the inside out, gasping for one ounce of simple wanting. I just want to be loved, desired, and seen as a fellow person with wants and needs that go beyond the scope of sex and emotions. And I'm terrified that I will never be able to accomplish such common events. I'm terrified that the next decades of my life are going to involves the same routine: waking up alone, craving one's touch, one's attention, one's yearning and unconditional adoration.

95,Haven’t had a proper human interaction in 2 months,"I go to college in a big-ish city and I dont have a single friend or even acquaintance in this entire state.

Nobody will come up and talk to me, and if I strike a conversation we’ll exchange 2 sentences before they dismiss me and look/walk away.

I haven’t had a single ‘hangout’ or interaction or anyth social whatsoever in 2 months - prior to this I had 2 friends who I had to cut off because they were beyond horrible, and even while i was friends with them I tried to make other friends and it didnt work.

Im starting to feel a little crazy. My subconscious seems to believe that I’ve died but I’m still stuck here. The only emotions I can feel are stress or emptiness. I have no desires, no hope, no faith in anything at all, especially not people. I never had this issue before, I was quite popular in high school. I’ve changed my approach and personality and mindset literally a million times trying to figure out what i’m missing that everybody else has and allows them to naturally just succeed socially.

97,Im 17 and i dont know what to do anymore,"
Hi, im 17F and english isnt my first language so sorry in advance for any mistakes. 
I think I genuinely destroyed the little life I had left

I've had depression for half my life and suicidal thoughts since forever, but last year in particular was worse than ever. To give a little context, I always had mental issues and I grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional family where almost everyone around me had BPD.

at the beginning of 2024 I lost all my friends because I changed schools and started working, some still checked on me from time to time but I lost all the affection I had for them after realizing the lack of interest they had for me, I also had acne for the first time in my life (I am extremely obsessive about my appearance) which led me to have extreme anxiety when interacting with other people and being in public, so I ended up socially isolating myself. Results: i stopped going to school and lost the year, and if I wanted to graduate I would have to do the entire school year from scratch and I would only get my diploma at 19 and a half years old. So I dropped out of school, the school year started approximately 2 months ago and I'm not enrolled and probably won't be. My parents don't care much about my education, they are pretty old already and stopped giving me direction in life a long time ago They didn't say anything when I lost the year or when I dropped out of school, they didn't say anything at all, but i guess they just lost the little hope they had for me.

I have no desire to go to college, or any interest in any course or profession, and to be honest I've always been like that, my parents never really made me think about my future, They kind of always just let me loose
The only thing I ever genuinely thought about being was a flight attendant, I'm conventionally attractive, people always said I have an elegant appearance, I would like to travel and live an eventful life, I'm great with languages ​​and until then I was pretty good at communicating

I don't know how I would graduate high school, the days go pass and I become more certain that I wouldn't be able to return and graduate late for a million reasons, there is the option of taking tests and graduating another way ig, but I have dyscalculia which makes everything 100 times more difficult.

After the disappointments I had with friendships last year I no longer have anyone by my side, and I don't really think Im able anymore to build new relationships. I don't have anyone that I love in my life.

The only escape for me would be to move to another city (I live in a very small city) but that would be impossible without the help of my family, and i dont think they want to help anymore 

So I think I'm just going to spend a few years lying in bed, watching life go by, just like my sister did

103,"My tent is destroyed, I’m homeless, I am really depressed. Why do this?","



I’m homeless, and have been for 8 months now. I got here through an injury I had two years ago, I was sadly bed bound for nearly 10 months. The rent built up and I was evicted and sadly fell into the cycle of being homeless. At first I slept in doorways but eventually saved enough money for a tent. After I got my tent I moved to the forest and have had a campsite there 5-6 months. It’s not dirty or unclean, I always make an effort to make it look presentable. It was all going well until last week when someone decided to put a knife through my tent causing multiple puncture wounds and causing unrepairable damage. My question is why? Do people get a kick out of destroying someone’s only home and ruining their only source of warmth at nighcgt? I can deal with the looks, I can deal with the passing comments and I can just about deal with the cold/wet weather. What I can’t deal with is when humans hurt me like this because I have no money and have to start back from the start. Now I’m sleeping in doorways again with nothing but hate and anger towards the person who did this to me. I am losing faith in humanity and I know that might seem like an immature statement but people have ground me down to nothing.

104,Lost interest in other people,"My family have mostly rejected me due to religion. As in I've chosen not to be part of their organisation, and enough time has now passed that there are new members of my family that I haven't even met. I'm not really interested in my friends anymore, and I haven't been to a social event for months, because I don't have any enthusiasm for it. What fulfilment could I find in that. Nothing impresses me, nothing really interests me. I just like to be at home with my partner, and if they go out, I'll stay home alone and just think. 

I work every day during the week. My coworkers who I've worked alongside for several years, completely puzzle me. Their lives seem totally 2 dimensional. They have no real interests to me, everything I like they view as stranger or quirky, but these are normal things to me. I don't like going to the gym and going clubbing. I don't like alcohol or coffee. I like animals, I like movies, I don't know if I like people very much maybe. I just don't connect with anyone except really my partner, who I don't really share this information with; but they know I'm struggling since the recent birth of my niece who I will not meet unless I start attending religious gatherings. I don't know. I connected with my brother. He doesn't want to associate with me anymore because of the religious element.

106,Life lately,"Kinda feel like I’m going into a spiral again. I really have been trying to be positive and focus on doing the right things but it always feels like I’m getting the shit end of everything. I sold my house because I could not keep up with bills and was always asking family for help putting a huge damper on relationships between everyone. I lost my job right as selling the home which made the prospect of buying another with the proceeds quickly fade, ended up bouncing around in air bnbs while looking for work. Got hired at a UPS center in another state so I moved to an air bnb close. To go in and be told “sorry we’re not really hiring”. Persistent I wanted the job I reapplied when they immediately posted another listing and same process, but this time was told I was on the “call list”. A month goes by with no call so I applied to another listing in the town over. Boom I’m in and on the schedule finally. Find a long term house to rent and all is seeming ok. Fast forward 6 months I’m laid off by UPS and after 4 months of this I’ve run through the last of my home proceeds unable to stay at the long term rental. Got in an RV and am full time with the family, not ideal but it has its ups and downs like everything. I’m learning to love it more because of the job issues. I went after another opportunity while still laid off that just wasn’t for my family and lost my position at UPS when they finally call me back 6 months later.  End up reapplying because it really is a good opportunity and I do well with the work. Same story come in and work for 6 months, as a permanent union employee, to then be laid off again. In the mix of all this I had gotten pulled over by some back woods cop that claimed I was driving 77 I’m a 60. I was going 62. Had been passed by a newer, different color car similar to mine. Again I’m laid off from work so busy seeking employment, ended up getting in with Amazon which I’ve really wanted to do for a while but there aren’t many centers in my rural area. Messed up didn’t realize court was same day as training for the job and now having to deal with another major infraction on my license history which will keep me from potentially driving at UPS which was my goal. Just tired of having so much going on and always forgetting something important and essentially screwing myself when I’ve been working so hard to get things in order for me and my family to have a stable environment.

108,My life feels blurry and low resolution?,"I remember I used to still feel things about up until I graduated high school but recently life has become so dull. I have no imagination anymore and I can't even sit alone with my thoughts. I used to go so many places in my head and see such vivid colors. Now all I can imagine is my worries so I fill my head with more content from the moment I go to bed to the moment I wake up. I take a walk every day and try to read once every few months but these are the only moments of peace I have. I can't stop scrolling because I want my mind to feel how it used to feel and I want novelty. I used to be able to create this myself but I can't anymore due to several episodes of depression and eating disorder that made my apathy worse. It has sucked the life out of every moment and dulled down every experience. I used to pride myself on how much I enjoyed beauty, nature, and creativity, but now I feel nothing when I see those things. My life has no spontaneity but the surprises that do come are always negative, which makes me want my miserable routine again. 

I honestly fear that I have lost myself because I do not recognize my thoughts. I haven't had a thought that didn't have some sort of neurotic origin in so long. The only times my brain cares to work are to let me know I am in danger or I am a failure. I do not perceive the possibilities right in front of me because the neural pathways for that seem to have been shut off from repeatedly being rejected and disappointed my my father. I want my own mind back and I don't recognize myself. I am a neurotic mess and I rarely say or think anything interesting anymore. I wear myself out and others out with my worries and then numb my brain out when I get too tired. It's a cycle that never ends and never gets anywhere. I don't even care if I am productive anymore, I just want to feel sometime moving in my mind that isn't neurotic. It can be anything that reminds me who I used to be and who I can become, preferably not on the internet all the time. I am trying to create a routine but it is hard to get my mind to stick to anything because I will literally zone out and just sit there due to the lack of dopamine in my brain.

About 75% of the time in the past 6 months, I (47F) wake up between 2am-4am and am in a partial sleep/awake cycle.  I can’t fully get back to sleep and I often can’t wake myself up. When I do wake, I can’t get back to sleep.  

During these episodes I have thoughts of people yelling at me telling me how dumb and inadequate I am. I will take issues I am dealing with at work and try to solve them, but am told my myself and others I am too stupid and why am I even trying. The comments become pretty dark at times, with me telling myself I would be better off if I was not alive. I can’t stop these thoughts. I feel as if I am tossing and turning during these thoughts. 

I am now getting 3-4 hours of sleep. I am already maxed out on 2 mental health meds and take trazodone to sleep.  My meds have t changed in 2 years. 

I have told my therapist and we have been working on these beliefs, but nothing has helped. It makes me feel like I am crazy.

I HAVE FUCKING NOBODY BECAUSE MY BOYFRIEND DOESNT WANT TO TELL HIS FRIENDS OR HAVE HIS FRIENDS KNOW WE'RE DATING AND HE DIDN'T SAY THIS PART BUT I KNOW IT'S BECAUSE THEY HATE ME!!!

He said he's going to tell this friend in ""due time"" AAAARGH!!!!!!!!

I don't want to go home so I'm just sat here on the grass, typing this.

115,Just getting some things off my chest,"Hello,

I need to write some things off my chest. I feel hopeless and don't know how to find the will to continue. I suffer from severe depressions since the age of 18, probably earlier too but that's when I got diagnosed.

Since then I'm in therapy, nothing really helped. I tried literally every antidepressant available. None worked. I went 2 times to stationary therapy, didn't help either. 

I can't keep a job because after 1 year the latest I'm so burned out, I don't want to leave my bed anymore. No job means no serious relationship. Yes, I get dates, even relationships but in the end they end because noone wants to be with someone that can't work.

In my 30s I suddenly found motivation. I managed to go to university, got a bachelor degree, lost 50kg of weight, stopped smoking and drinking. I feel more miserable than before. Before I had hope: if you lose weight it will be better, if you get a degree it will be better... Now I have 0 hope and energy left.

I can't find a job anymore, I live on benefits right now. Nobody wants to hire someone that changes jobs every year. Truth is, i couldn't even do a job right now. Just getting out of bed to shower costs me so much energy that I immediately go back to bed. I spent 44 of the last 48 hours in bed. 

My life looks like this. I wake up at around 6 am, eat something, shower and go back to bed. At 9h30 i go to the gym until 11. Then i come home and sleep, often until the next day 6am.

117,I had an honest conversation with my psychiatrist about how hard I try to look fine on the outside while feeling completely empty on the inside,"I usually try to keep the conversation really shallow and list symptoms that are getting better or worse but yesterday was different.

My psychiatrist asked me how I've been feeling for the past 4 months. I said I have been feeling pretty stable. She asked me what I mean by stable and I explained that I haven't felt any emotion really, no lows but no highs, I completely feel flat and empty. She asked me do I cry so I said I don't. It's been so long and I don't even feel anything that would make me cry. She asked me do I tend to be in my room a lot so I said yes, I shower after work and go into my room. She asked me whether I eat in my room so I said yes. She asked me if I even hang out with my family and I said not really, it's not that I don't want to, I just can't make myself be with people. She asked me if I communicate with people on work and I said I do in bursts, I keep very light-hearted persona, always smiling and chatting when people approach me or say something but I usually get back to being unresponsive once I'm left alone and I end up coming home very exhausted. However, lately I've been really quiet and I don't participate in conversations. I keep very functional persona on work, I try my hardest not to make a mistake but when I can't control it, I make mistakes for the whole day and I get scared I'm going to be let go and be replaced with no financial security.

Sure, I don't feel a lot when I'm awake but when I'm asleep I always have nightmares because that's the only time I process anything. I rarely feel as if I even slept despite sleeping for 6-13h.

She said she's concerned about me because it seems like I've been in this cocoon, not really expecting anything out of this world. I said it's true because I don't even find joy or anything positive out of stuff and that's usually why I struggle with even hopping into shower, washing my hair, making a coffee, eating, anything really because I don't see the end goal leading to positive feeling so I ask myself what's the point anyway. If the fear didn't prevail this feeling, I'd be a really unhygienic person.

She recommended for me to connect to people no matter how hard it seems and is because people are truly rotten nowadays, I have to judge correctly. I then realized I keep everyone at distance and I lost all connections I had with my friends. I cancel gatherings all the time. I feel like we don't click. I feel like we're at two different parallels so I can't be with them for long without feeling distance which makes the empty feeling even worse.

We changed therapy and she said she really wants me to feel better. I said I truly hope so myself because it's been a long time since I started attending therapy but I can't shake off the feeling that I'm getting worse in a sense that I'm falling deeper into the void like feeling.

I'm truly exhausted from this mask I'm carrying when I'm outside and I wish I could just be what I am. Maybe I'd finally accept that I don't feel well.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivjt0r/i_had_an_honest_conversation_with_my_psychiatrist/,Visible-Cup3874,1740234174.0,depression
118,"Across Continent, Back to Nothing—The System’s Broken and I’m at the End of My Road","I’m 27, single, and stuck in Southend-on-Sea on £368 a month from Universal Credit. My story starts at the end of 2023, when my mum kicked me and my half-brother out of her house in Basildon. He went to his dad’s and I was left with a suitcase, a backpack, and a sliver of savings. I’d lived in Basildon most of my life—stale, suffocating, no horizon. So I took a National Express coach to Glasgow, chasing a fresh start, transferring my Pizza Hut job from Essex up there—or trying to.

I landed on a cold January morning, rented a Safestore unit to stash my stuff week-to-week, and hunted a room. Found one, fair rent, if I could prove work. My manager set an interview and store location, but it fell apart—he couldn’t parse the Glaswegian accent, and the store was hours from Glasgow, not in it. No job, no cash—Glasgow’s few hostels couldn’t guarantee a bed in a city that size. I could’ve been on the streets any night. I bailed—took a train to Fort William, booked a hotel for two days, climbed Ben Nevis three-quarters up. The views were unreal, worth it—then I fractured my meniscus coming down. Limping, stubborn as hell, I boarded a coach to London. With 50-plus hostels, I figured I’d have a shot. I did—not a day rough, landed a gig at a Young’s pubs, averaging 70-hour weeks, roughly £3,000 a month after tax. It wasn’t guaranteed—I’d snatch extra shifts, lean on service charge tips to turn minimum wage into something decent. I hustled, saved, breathed—£20 a night in hostels left £2,500.

That held till I left for Kenya—two and a half months in Nairobi and Mombasa. No one owed me housing; I had no promises—just a vague hope the system might catch me eventually. I stood in the mandamano tax protests—crowds raging over living costs, tear gas thick, my phone shaky as I filmed. Kenya’s third-world—poverty’s brutal, no NHS—but there’s a raw edge. Life’s harder, no cushion, yet cash moves mountains. I rented a room in Mombasa for £20, a handshake—no forms, no delays. Matatus cost pennies. I saw struggle, but people got by without red tape strangling them. I came back to the UK thinking a “first-world” system would back that kind of effort, hold me up if I stumbled. Instead, I landed unemployed, gutted, and shipped to Southend—housed in a £700-a-month room, covered by housing benefit, bills included. I thought it’d be a foothold after hostels and Kenya’s chaos. It’s a trap.

Southend’s an economic dead zone—full-time’s 30 hours max, £11.44 now, £12.21 in April, £1,200 a month after tax if I could snag it. I’ve hunted daily—retail, hospitality, warehouses—just part-time scraps. London’s got nightclub jobs—£2k or £3k a month, shifts I’d kill at—but £450 c2c fares to Fenchurch Street eat a quarter, and the 00:25 last train kills late closes. I’m jobless, alone—no friends, family, savings—£12 a day from Universal Credit. I can’t save to move, can’t chase better. I’m stuck in a town that’s flatlined, and the staleness is suffocating.

Six months back, I took this place, thinking it’d steady me. Now I’ve got Stockholm syndrome—pining for hostels, London’s grind, those extra shifts I’d fight for. If I’d dodged Southend, stayed in London, I’d have faced short-term chaos, not this—half a year as an unemployed NEET, rotting in a system that’s just not there. No one guaranteed me a thing; I didn’t expect a handout—but I figured the UK’s setup would work, not dump me in despair. It doesn’t. Universal Credit’s £368 traps me—too little to climb out, too much to quit. Labour’s in—homes by 2029, energy by 2030, £12.21 in April—it’s too far, too thin. No train fare cuts, no rent relief—just tax hikes and pensioner fuel cuts while I fade.

I’m at the end of my road—deeply depressed, hopeless, wishing my journey didn’t end here. Kenya showed cash opens doors; here, the system’s a void—broken, indifferent. I’ve worked hard—70-hour weeks on grit, climbed mountains half-broken, stood in protests abroad. Now I’m a ghost, let down by a country I think’s lost its spine—opportunity, fairness, a chance. Reform’s noise beats Labour’s silence when I’m hurting, though I don’t trust their fix. Am I alone—or is someone fighting this? Words, ideas—I need a sign I’m not done.






I just want to clarify that my previous statement wasn’t meant as a call for support of any specific reform or political party. It’s not about trusting a particular solution but rather expressing my frustration with the system as it stands. I’m not looking for a political fix, just a recognition of how broken things are for people like me, and a real shift in how the system works for those who need it most.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ive409/across_continent_back_to_nothingthe_systems/,cpatrick1061,1740212415.0,depression

123,Is it normal to rationalize your symptoms ? Do you ever doubt that you're really depressed,"I don't believe I suffer from a severe form of depression. But it's hard enough right now that I consider taking the SSRIs I got prescribed a few months ago. I'm just in constant doubt about what I feel and the ""true source"" of what I feel.
- if I'm almost unable to give physical love to my girlfriend, maybe it's because I don't love her anymore
- if I sleep like shit, take more than one hour to get asleep, and wake up by myself after ~5 hours maximum of sleep, that's probably because she moves in her sleep and snores and wakes me up
- if I have very low appetite during the day, it's surely because I have near zero physical activity, and don't need as much energy as before
- if I have constant mood swings, it must be because I'm tired as fuck
- if I don't really enjoy things anymore, or at least don't have the motivation to do them anymore, maybe it's because I'm just getting older and stop liking all this stuff, and I'm tired
And so on.

At some point the depression was kind of obvious. Randomly crying. Complete paralysis during the day. But now I don't know anymore. It feels like there's a problem obviously, but I'm not sure it's depression. Maybe it's the sleep that got bad, for whatever reason, and now I'm stuck in a loop. Tried melatonin, does not do shit. Tried sleeping pills, but they fuck you up the day after.

126,Leave him alone or be persistent,"The guy I'm dating is depressed and not replying and leaving me on read.

His depression started after our latest out-of-town weekend; the messaging pattern from him was texting less and replying late. Later on, he told me he is in depression again. I told him I'm always there for him.

For 2 weeks he was like that, so I decided to visit him for a welfare check, but it was a mistake; I hope I never did. He somehow let me in his home, but I felt he was angry because he had told me before he wanted to be alone and didn't know when he was going to be okay. I became so worried; that's why I had a welfare check on him.On that night I was there, he called me selfish, said there's nothing I can do about it, and he doesn't understand why people care. He locked his bedroom door, and I was left there looking so desperate to comfort him because I heard him having nightmares; it hurt me. Later that night I decided to leave because I think what I did (visiting him) was wrong; seeing from his reaction, I had never seen him like that. Cried driving home that night. I also felt I somehow lost my self-respect, but I know he's going through something I can't understand, so I tried to forget that happened.

Weeks pass again after that incident. We still talk; I message him once daily to check on him, but he replies almost a day late. I also asked him if I could visit him again and told me he still wants to be alone, so I didn't. One time he told me to remove him from my life so that I'll stay happy again and there's nothing for me to worry about. I told him that I want him in my life not only for the happy days, and I'm always there when he's ready to talk.Since that message, he just left it on read and never replied. 

Maybe he just really wants to be in solitude? That's why I tried to not bother him for a week.

Then just this weekend I messaged him. I tried to invite him to go somewhere because maybe it will help, but he refused, saying he just wants to be on his bed. Told him I'll be out of the country mostly for March; that's why I want to spend time with him and remind him I'm still here. He just left it on seen.

On several occasions, he told me before that he has depression since we started dating, so I'm trying my best to be there for him all throughout this phase.

What should I do? It honestly also hurts.

128,I can't get my shit together.,"My life has been a mess since I was born. I frequently -- and severely -- procrastinate on my school assignments, I struggle to go to work because I absolutely despise my job (but I can't quit because I need to pay the bills), I can't motivate myself to enjoy my hobbies anymore, I can't be bothered to clean my apartment and do laundry, I can't go to sleep on a regular basis, and I can't be bothered to properly eat anything because it's just too inconvenient to do so.

Why was I even born? Unfortunately, it's too difficult -- and painful -- to die. I'm also unmotivated to pack up my personal belongings in the case that I happen to get around to killing myself, but even the latter is highly unlikely since I don't have the guts to, and also because I've been in the habit of severely procrastinating on everything since the day of my birth.

In my ideal life, I would like to wake up by 7 AM, eat a well-balanced breakfast, complete chores/errands/schoolwork, take a walk, eat a healthy lunch/dinner, regularly shower, read, and go to bed by 9 PM.

Below is a summary for some of my feelings that make me genuinely hate living on a planet with other humans. Please give me any counter arguments you have that may result in a more optimistic way of thinking. Or perhaps general advice that I could use to see from a different perspective. Thanks.

  
  
I will try to keep this short. The majority of the people who live on this earth fucking suck and are a pure cancer to having a productive society. I have been chronically online for about 15 years ever since I got my first functioning smartphone. There are no spaces online you can go to without trolls, shitposters, or overt dickheads saying something insane that just ruins your day. Like okay cool you did something really malicious but I guess the person who you're actively fucking with doesn't matter because it was over the internet.



For example, I once posted a very innocent comment under someone's post. Just an observation about an inconsistency in a video game. Their ego got bruised for some reason and they instantly resorted to calling me a dateless loser, scrolled through my profile, and used a post I made about having depression in order to make fun of me. Awesome. That's totally not completely unhinged behavior, this has no real moral implications and you will never have to answer to God for the hurt you bring upon others. My bad for asking you about the ranking system in a video game, thank you for telling me to kill myself.



People are usually the same in real life as well, I'm not gonna lie. I was dealing with psychotic delusions for years and had one person in particular completely abuse that fact and get away with it. He constantly scammed me out of my shit because he knew I was desperate for drugs and not in the right state of mind. He laced me with psychadelics multiple times. He's a serial woman abuser and does nothing in his life but hurt the people around him. He had me questioning whether or not it was all just in my own head because he knew he could easily gaslight a diagnosed schizophrenic. I was only able to cut him off because an acquaintance of ours let me know he told them that I'm just a ""fat retard he manipulates into doing whatever he wants"". And the best part about that is that he will likely NEVER face the consequences of his own actions, he just doesn't have a conscience and is not afraid to fully socially reset at any time.



That was an example coming off of the extreme side, but it was really eye opening for me. I'd say the ratio of people in the world that are evil compared to the ones that are good is like a 90:10, bare minimum. Existence itself to us is a massive dick measuring contest. I am coming to accept the fact that unless a series of miracles make their way into my lap, I'm never gonna be able to change anything about that. I'm thinking more and more that the only way I'd ever feel some kind of happiness from this life is to go completely off the grid and live in the woods somewhere, devoid of human contact. 



Just to clarify. I am absolutely not doing well in terms of being a productive human being. But I have a clear path ahead of me that I'm following. I can easily live a stable life in the future and engage in whatever activity I want. But, genuinely, what's the point in putting in so much work just to stay surrounded by pieces of shit my whole life?

And they're good songs. A bit unpolished, but that's to be expected. He's just...I wish I could be more like him. Because he actually seems to like living. He is living, as opposed to me just kinda surviving. I can't even bring myself to dislike him because he deserves his happiness and success. I fully believe that he will be famous at some level one day. He has what it takes to make it at least decently big and I'll be so happy for him when he does. I just kinda feel like shit though, for being a struggling college kid doubting their own future.

Nearly everyday I realize how much that has affected the way I grew up and how I continue to navigate as an adult. I try very hard to ""get better,"" but every step forward, I fall backwards in another area. 

I am going to lose my job in a month so that the giant conglomerate i work for can save money and hire overseas. I didn't make enough to live comfortably anyway. 

I am old and ugly, so the dating apps are useless and nobody approaches me. 

The funny thing is, nobody would ever guess I'm struggling so much. I am extremely good at hiding it and being the one to make people laugh, so people just assume I'm fine. People have said ""oh you're so fun, you are a light,"" blah blah. I am that way because I don't want anyone to feel what I feel.

It’s hard for me to get out of this mindset, and the more I think about it… I find that I despise everything about myself. I isolate myself because of this… it’s like a morbid fascination.

I got more upset, told her she couldnt help and wasnt helping at all by yelling at me, but she just kept yelling saying she doesnt know what to do.

I’ve been doing so shitty recently. I’ve been really suicidal and I was talking to my therapist and he asked me if I had any hope at all for the future. Not gonna lie, being able to transition and actually present as a dude 24/7 when I’m an adult is one of the only reasons I’m still going. So I told him I was transgender which I’ve been trying to get the nerve to do for a year and a half. I’m 16, I started questioning at 11 and I’ve known for around 3/4 years just had to unpack a lot of religious trauma. Anyway, coming out to a real person, terrifying. I had it in my head that I would have to somehow ‘prove myself’ to him, but he just went and asked me about my name and pronouns and then we talked about my sick vans
I’m so happy, and it just makes me feel even worse about still having to be closeted (for my safety, not trying to get disowned by my very conservative pastor of a dad).

178,I don't know how to get out of depression,"TW!!!

I've been struggling with depression and suicidal ideation since the age of six (I'm 18 now) I've tried every single prescribable antidepressant on the market and I'm currentlyon antipsychotics which don't help much. I've been on ketamine treatments for a few months, but they're not really helping either. My first suicide attempt was when I was seven years old and it was because my dad made me feel like I was a failure and basically ever since then I've never been able to get out that loop. I feel like I'm a failure no matter how hard I try or no matter how many times I try to get out of the house and do things I don't wanna do. i feel like I'm just getting further and further into depression. My last attempt was about a week ago, and it was almost successful. I just wanna be free of depression and it's honestly taking my whole life away from me. I don't know what to do anymore and I just honestly want to disappear. I wish I could be happy and I wish I wanted to do stuff and I wish I wanted to hang out with people. I wish I could wake up and smile every morning would be grateful for my life, but I just feel like I can't because I'm being drowned by depression. It's so draining and I don't think people understand how hard it is living with depression. My parents always told me that I was just being dramatic or dumb and told me that me trying to end my life was stupid and I was just being dramatic, but I just wanted it to stop. I'm honestly getting so tired and I wish I could just feel pretty and like I'm worth something. It's always been my dream to get married and start a family one day, but I feel like that's never gonna happen because of my depression. I feel like depression is taking everything from me and it's starting to take my life. i've never felt so hopeless and worthless in my life, and I don't even know what to do anymore. also, I moved about 400 miles away from my hometown a couple years ago and I have basically no friends and it's not helping me at all. I just feel like I have no purpose in life and that I would be better off not here. I feel like people would be happier if I wasn't here and I wouldn't be a burden anymore to them. I guess this is just a vent post, but I just really need help and I don't know what to do.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivdcr1/i_dont_know_how_to_get_out_of_depression/,CarelessInterview272,1740209187.0,depression

180,My relationship most likely destroyed me.,"I (31M) have been in a relationship with my partner (41F) for eight years, and we have a 6-year-old daughter together. On paper, our life looks good—we both have stable jobs, a home, two cars, and live a healthy lifestyle. We don’t drink or smoke, and we work out regularly. But beneath the surface, my mental health has been deteriorating for years, and in the past nine months, it has reached a breaking point.

I’ve always been a positive, energetic person, but now I struggle with crippling anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. I also experience occasional memory issues, like completely forgetting a 40-minute car ride or large parts of a day. At first, I blamed my job, which was toxic and stressful, but I left it in January for a position I love. I also quit caffeine, which significantly reduced my anxiety, yet I still feel trapped and empty.

I’ve tried therapy—multiple times. Every therapist pointed to a lack of freedom in my life, which deeply resonates. Over the past seven years, I’ve focused entirely on building a career so I could provide for my partner and child. In doing so, I lost nearly all my friends, partly because I never had time for them and partly because my depression made me difficult to be around. Meanwhile, my partner has always been the head of the household. While we both work and contribute, it feels like I exist solely to earn, take care of responsibilities, and ensure everything runs smoothly.

Our relationship has been riddled with arguments, and they always follow the same pattern: no matter the issue, it somehow becomes my fault—usually tied to my mental health and not “trying hard enough.” Recently, these fights have escalated into the worst I’ve ever experienced in my life. I finally confided in her about my suicidal thoughts, hoping for understanding, but she said she didn’t know how to help and was exhausted from trying. I mentioned the possibility of leaving, just for my own mental well-being, and she had no real reaction—until the conversation shifted into an argument where she accused me of having an affair. She even went through my phone, found nothing, we fought brutally, and now, just a day later, she’s sitting next to me acting like everything is fine, as if none of it happened.

I feel emotionally detached from her, and I no longer love her. Honestly, after years of these toxic fights, I doubt she loves me either. But every time I try to leave, I somehow end up staying for another few months until things explode again. Then, like clockwork, she acts as if everything is normal for a while, and the cycle repeats.

I’m starting to wonder: am I overanalyzing this, or is something deeply wrong here? Am I being manipulated into staying? Or is this just what a long-term relationship with a child looks like?",7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1iv2feb/my_relationship_most_likely_destroyed_me/,thrwawybyeaway,1740173777.0,depression

182,Hi. This is me:,"Sensitive. Sober. Sleepless. Systemic breakdowns. Zoning out to symbolize giving up, but that's all it can do. Only in meaning. But who is it for? Do I deserve to when I could be making money for someone else?

Medicated with mental zip ties and liquid bandage of a treatment plan. Social desolate. Unforgivable. A pathetic drunk. To be talked at and given orders to but never to listen to understand. A cursed entity. Never been a good hang. You gotta be a good hang. Just be one, c'mon. Crudely put together as if a statement art piece for the appreciation of ugliness, rebellion, and more chaos. A permanent lost cause. A history of being taken advantage of to make themselves feel better.

Emotionally, a rusty barbed-wire fence in a shallow puddle of aloe vera. Spiritually, a 10 year old boy crying out and asking for help to the wrong people. And it's always the wrong people. An awkward silence killer. One of the most taboo persons to root for. Creepy. A creeper. Gives me the ick. Gross. Weirdo. A spreading sadness and its pervasive boundaries. 

An anxious and uncomfortable human being to be around. Pessimistic. Cynical. Jaded. Educated on the wrong ideas of the human mind and society. Way too political. Untrained in true joy and happiness. Unwilling to submit to capitalism and its demands. But this sentiment will have to give up. Sorry bud. At least you can daydream about it.

A loner. Unworthy. Dishonorable. To lash out on. Contains almost no value. Extremely punishable, but not to death (that would be selfish, can't be selfish). Family outcast, a title that's horribly troublesome for any peace of mind. Hot topic of gossip but nothing more. Any more would be unthinkable. You're tripping if you want more with him. Not even home serves freedom from judgement. What is a true home and what does it feel like? Home is where the heart wants to lay and find rest after a life-changing road trip. The soul would like to join too. I just want to sleep and dream. 

To The Creator, oh please. Grant me the essence of peace, joy, happiness, acceptance, and forgiveness. 

If not, grant me peace through death. And for grief to be quick, easy, and fulfilling for them. They deserve that the most. ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ivd3yr/hi_this_is_me/,GethJordon,1740208180.0,depression
183,I just don't understand life,"I don't know if other people are just really ignorant, or if I'm too stupid to understand it, but life just doesn't seem worth the effort. Why live if I don't see working and then sleeping for the third of my life worth it? I don't think the occasional moments of happiness really justify the amount of time spent either doing something you don't want to or being unconscious either, and no, there's not a single job that would make me happy. Trust me, I've been hopping from job to job for a while. Now, I'm not denying that there are people that seemingly have fulfilling lives, but what really annoys me is when people assume that everyone's circumstances are the same and as a result think that life is worth living for everyone. For example, even though I am physically capable of working and doing everything that an average person can, I'm just not mentally strong enough to deal with this bullshit. I also see myself as a really small minded and stupid person, and this isn't just the case of an impostor sindrome or something like that. I can tell by the way other people interact with me, that they clearly feel pity for me and explain everything in way more detail then they usually would to other people, simply because they don't trust me enough to do something without messing up. It's not the fault of those people either, since I've been known to mess up in the dumbest ways possible. I'm just not capable of learning certain things, no matter how hard I try. My mind is just blissfully empty and it always has been, so it's not just depression that's causing all of this. In all honesty, I've been trying my best to find a single good reason to not go through with it, but I never found a good reason.Then again, maybe I'm not smart enough to see it.

194,I have 0 mental strength and need guidance,"Issues:
1. I’m in college but my mindset is still fixed to “if I don’t do well in school my life is over”. I have been stressed and lost sleep over the past few years. Given the current job market, I don’t think it is necessarily a “wrong” mindset, but I’m definitely miserable because of it.
2. I’m definitely lonely, but I’ve put in no effort to make friends, so I have barely any friends and deserve to have none. There’s no one I can repeatedly rant to and dump all my negative emotions onto. My family does not provide any emotional support.
3. I’ve always been too “busy” procrastinating and have no time to have any hobbies. I have gotten rid of all social media I doom scrolled. I have gotten rid of the very few hobbies I had, partially due to lack of family support. (Why do I need support to keep a hobby anyway? Maybe trace back to the lack of mental strength.) Anyway I am officially hobby-less. 
4. The past few months, the past few weeks, the past few days, I’ve been losing more and more strength to push through. Especially today, I feel like I can’t do it anymore. Bad thoughts keep occurring. Up till this point and as of right now, my body has taken zero damage. But that is just because I am a coward and cannot risk anyone finding out any damage on me. But I’m feeling more and more fearless while fearing this might take a turn really soon.
5. I have tried “taking a break” and “doing something I like” but there’s nothing I want to do. I don’t even want to doom scroll or do the things I’ve been wanting to for the past few years. Nothing productive I want to do, nothing useless I want to do. In the past 48 hours, I got up to wash up, have simple foods, then laid in bed staring at the ceiling until I fall asleep, and start over again. There is almost nothing I look forward to.
6. “seek help”. I agree I need help but I have “no time”, no insurance, no car, no physical ability to see anyone. Even my school’s service require referrals or assessments.
7. I am trying so hard to not get into any substances but at the same time I wish I can feel better.
8. I did some googling to look for advice. But it’s like I have an excuse ready, or someone to blame ready, for anything.

I’m genuinely lost. I don’t know where to start to change anything. I’m tired. I feel ungrateful. I’m privileged and too spoiled. I feel like a failure.

198,I was fired yesterday,"So I’m a hairstylist, a new one as I started on the floor in April, but the one I work at I’ve been over a year. It hasn’t necessarily helped my depression but gave me a reason to get up in the morning, gave me routine, and communicating with coworkers was also helpful.

Yesterday my boss called me into her office with someone else and was a bit quiet, then showed me photos of the haircut I did last week. She told me there’s no words for it and the salon can’t have it, and she will have to let me go.

Last week I had a really bad day and messed up 2 haircuts. I talked to my hairdresser friend about it and she said I was being ridiculous when I had the suspicion I was going to be fired and that they can’t do that to someone new.

I remember the deadpan stare my boss gave me after she said “I will have to let you go,” just absolute emptiness. I legit felt the color drain from my face. I got a trash bag and packed up my things, and when I went to the back a few of my coworkers were there. They were surprised and said they didn’t want me to go. I told them all I love you while I was crying, hugged them goodbye and that’s it.

I tried calling my mom after and she was getting her nails done. She was getting a service at my salon while I was being fired. 

I called my mentor and she said she had no idea it was going to happen either. And that she’s surprised my boss would go as far as to fire her assistant (my mentor was on vacation and that’s why I had to call her instead of talking in person). She told me she would help me find another place. A few of my coworkers want me to keep  them updated which I’m really thankful for.

When I went home I laid in bed, cried, couldn’t move or focus on anything. My body felt like it was in pain and it was hard to fall asleep. Today I found enough energy to eat and shower but I’ve been laying down. I told a few ppl I’m going to take a week break. I’m gonna evaluate my life, because at this point I don’t know if I’m interested in moving on in that career. I never want to go through that again. I’m in a state of derealization where I feel like I’m in a weird dream and will wake up soon. My mind thought of self harm but I haven’t done it, I know it’s not a good idea. I’m not sure what to do or if I have the energy for anything. This is the first time I’ve been fired and I thought I would be working there for years. Now my body is in fight or flight mode.

200,There's Nothing Left,"Every day, it seems, I mourn myself. I used to be optimistic and happy. I used to believe in *something* or that my life had some kind of purpose. That it served some kind of goal. I just don't see it anymore.

I used to enjoy school and learning things. I used to enjoy talking to my friends and other people in my life. I get nothing out of it anymore. Now, I just feel stressed. Every day is just something added to my life that I don't want. I just want to go back to bed and sleep every single day. The only thing I look forward to is eating and sleeping and hopefully for a long time so I have less of a day ahead of me. 

The most annoying part is that my psychiatrist doesn't take me seriously. She's given me the bogus diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified because I seemed happy when I went in her office and said I felt angry and irritable when I took SSRIs. I felt angry because I was stressed and just angry at my life and how it's turning out. Even when you put me on mood stabilizers, I'm mad. Being mad isn't mania. Whatever. 

There's nobody here anymore. No beliefs. No spiritual element or soul. No higher purpose. Just unconsciously performing the same routines every day. 

And you know, I feel guilty. I have some friends who live paycheck-to-paycheck and regularly can't feed themselves. Why am I even unhappy in my comfortable life and high GPA? I got funding money for a research project. My boss was all excited and all I could muster was a tiny fake smile. It should have been something I celebrated but I felt nothing. I worked hard and my mind's reward to me is absolutely nothing. It's like running in place for 3 miles. I did all of this work and I'm in the same place. Nothing makes me happy anymore. Life is a constant drudge and as I get older it doesn't seem like it will get better. Just more work. More responsibilities. 

I really want to end but I can't. I don't want to hurt my friends and family but continuing like this is so difficult. It's like I have stage 4 cancer and I'm in constant, chronic pain, only mental.

207,Evaluation,"Evaluation

Hey, I just had an evaluation for partial hospitalization today, and I wanted to share what happened because I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. The whole experience left me confused and a little upset, especially with some of the things my mom said during the process. Here’s how it went:

So, the therapist and I were going through the usual questions, talking about my past, mood swings, and all that stuff. Then, during the depression test, the therapist asked about “defiance,” and my mom immediately said yes. That caught me off guard, and I didn’t expect it. She explained that I was defiant because of the whole situation with the ambulance. 
Because I was about to act on my suicidal thoughts so that’s why I called them, but she was upset that I didn’t go to her first


I called 911 instead of going to her first, which was part of my safety plan. According to my mom, that was considered defiant behavior.

This really threw me off because I don’t understand why she’s focusing so much on that. If I had gone to her, what would she have done anyway? I felt like my safety plan was kind of useless because, in that moment, I felt like my best option was calling 911. The whole situation just felt really confusing.

Then, my mom started talking about social media being bad for me because I sometimes look up things that lead to self-diagnosis. I don’t look at videos to self-diagnose at all, but I do watch videos or read stuff to feel supported or relate to others. She said it’s the same as self-diagnosing, and that made me feel embarrassed. I tried to explain that I don’t do it that way, and I was just trying to connect with people, but she insisted that it’s harmful. That really bothered me, and I felt like I had to defend myself even though I don’t really do that.

We talked about my mood swings too. I said that sometimes I can feel really up, but it’s not necessarily related to my medication. I told her about an episode over the summer where I stayed up for two days straight, and my mom dismissed it as “normal teenage stuff.” She compared it to her own experiences when she was my age and said that it’s just part of growing up. But, I really didn’t feel like it was normal, especially when my friend said they’ve never stayed up for multiple days because of feeling happy.

Then the therapist said something about how it’s teenage issues, but she wasn’t talking about the staying up.

My mom agreed and said exactly that—it’s just me being a teenager. But I tried to explain that comparing myself isn’t in a negative way; I’m just trying to understand if what I’m going through is normal or not.

I go through extreme highs, like having so much energy and motivation, and then I drop down to very low lows. I don’t think that’s regular teenage behavior, and that’s what I was trying to explain to them.

During the evaluation, the therapist said that my OCD could be the reason for my extreme suicidal thoughts. I told her that I really want to act on them, that if I could do it right then, I would. I was once told that suicidal thoughts could be a part of puberty, and I get that, but I actually want to act on them. I’ve been having them since I was about 11 years old.

She also mentioned that I might be blaming others when I think of myself as a burden. That part really stuck with me because I don’t think that’s what’s happening. I’ve been trying to get better, but I don’t think it’s as simple as blaming others. I just feel like a burden, and I don’t blame anyone for it. It’s just hard when my little sister has to help me get around, and I’m 16 years old. She said I believe things that aren’t true and that I’m hard on myself, which I agree with.

Then the therapist asked, “What do you want to get treatment for?” I said I want to learn how to control my thoughts because that’s what everyone is saying I need to do. She asked my mom the same question, and she said she wants me to learn how to manage myself better, like understanding that just because I had a bad day doesn’t mean I should act on suicidal thoughts. But it’s not because I had a bad day—it’s just that the thoughts are so intense. Like I wake up and I think about it all day and if I could do it I would like right now 

After all of that, as we were walking out, I told my mom how I felt about the self-diagnosis thing. She suggested we ask the therapist again, so we did. We walked back, and my mom rang the doorbell. I asked the therapist, “Do you view me differently when my mom says that I self-diagnose?” She said I contradict myself a lot but didn’t think any differently of me. I told her I felt like I was being misunderstood, like when my mom said it’s just teenage stuff or that I self-diagnose. It felt like it could raise a red flag and make people not take me seriously. The therapist reassured me that she didn’t think that way.

The biggest thing that’s bothering me, though, is the “defiant” part. My mom thinks I’m being defiant because I don’t follow through with the plans she thinks I should, especially when it comes to religion and my mental health. She says I’m stuck because I don’t choose God, and that I’m “overthinking everything” instead of trusting the process.

I guess what I’m really stuck on is that when I do things like calling 911, I don’t think it’s defiant. It’s just that in those moments, I’m trying to stay safe. But it seems like every time I make a decision like that, my mom or others look at it as me being defiant or rebellious, and it just feels frustrating.

Also, I mentioned that I watch Dr. Phil as a coping mechanism, and the therapist  and my mom both of them at the same time 
said that was a problem too, because it’s tied to my mental health. I tried explaining that I just need stimulation because I get bored easily and my brain needs constant engagement. She said I could find other ways to stimulate my brain, like reading a book. That felt like another way of invalidating what helps me in those moments, even though I just need something to keep me distracted. It was my mom really saying that the therapist was agreeing 

I’m really trying my best, but it’s like I’m stuck in this loop of second-guessing everything. I just don’t want to feel like I’m misunderstood.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or felt like their mental health was dismissed or misunderstood by family during an evaluation? Any advice on how to navigate these feelings?
I would go to my friends but they are my age and my
Mom said I have my friends now but they are going to want some reciprocity and they don’t want to have to walk on eggshells around me because they don’t know what might trigger me to think about suicide or to trigger my anxiety she calls it so-called anxiety though

I think mainly that's because I'm not happy with the life I have now by 32 years of age. I got to the point where I'm alone, don't have any savings anymore, and it naturally makes me start trying to figure out what I did wrong, where I did a mistake or mistakes, so all this led me to this point. 

From one side, I have some regrets and I'd really love to see how life would go if I changed my decisions in some situations or did differently. Would life be really different and I'd be in a different position now? Or maybe if I even had a chance to change a certain situation, it would still get me to the same point where I'm now? 

From another side, I try to defend myself thinking that I tried to do my best at each period of my life. I always wanted a better life and better outcome.

And he wouldn't care if I was dead right? 

I keep reminding myself this, and that I'm a terrible person who deserves to die so I shouldn't talk to anyone anyway and I should just end it. It would make everyone especially him happier. I regret the note so bad. The guilt and regret kills me everyday. He never talked to me about it, he pretended nothing happend. I want to atleast apologise before I die.

246,It feels like life keeps getting worse no matter what I do,"26F - I feel like I'm spiraling, and giving up seems like the only option. I do want to change, but every time I try, it feels pointless. I’ve put in effort so many times—in school, in college, in post-grad—but I never got the results I hoped for. I worked hard in 10th and 11th, only to struggle again later. I barely made it through post-grad, and even when I pushed myself harder than ever, it still wasn’t enough to feel like I truly succeeded.

I have no social life. My classmates never really included me, and over time, I just stopped trying to connect with people. Now, I barely have any friends, and I don’t even know how to change that. I don’t have a job. I’m trying to study for random exams, but I don’t know if I even believe it’s going to work out for me. I force myself to keep going, but deep down, I feel like I’m just wasting my time.

It’s not just that—I haven’t really gone out in over a year. The only times I leave the house are for doctor’s appointments, and even that feels overwhelming sometimes. I have severe self-esteem issues. My hands get shaky when I try to step outside, and the thought of going out just feels exhausting. It’s like a part of me doesn’t even want to try anymore.

I was bullied in high school and college. The people who mocked me back then have moved on to happy, successful lives—good jobs, relationships, everything. And people say good things happen to good people, but what the heck? I’ve only ever seen them happy.

250,Fuck this illness. I want out of here.,"Hey. Writing this because I am tired of spiralling every couple weeks. I was diagnosed with medium depression four years ago which apparently became severe depression over the years. I have been lucky enough to be able to turn to my ""local"" hospitals for ambulatory and stationary psychiatric and psychological treatment. Received therapy for a little over a year in 2022/23 and am currently on various antidepressants from stationary treatment I left this January. However, nothing seems to be helping long-term. As in, I am kind of ""okay"" forcing myself to do things for one or two weeks before I fall into a hole again where I don't really care about anything, can only do even the smallest things using immense amounts of energy and basically feeling like a waste of space just leeching off of my family to indulge in any kind of instant-gratification method (junk food, videogames, social media, porn) to distract myself from having to grow up and taking life into my own hands. I don't see any reason to keep going, everything seems so overly complicated and ultimately pointless. The last couple of days I noticed again how I did not want to go to sleep so a new day wouldn't start. Can't seem to stick to any kind of schedule I make for myself or am given (e.g. by my vocational training), since I'm not really concerned with the concept of time or don't want to realize that my time here is limited. Is there anyone out there who felt similarly and can give me suggestions on what to do other than ""only you can save yourself""? Cause that's what I've been trying to do, and let me tell you, I am beyond full of it. How is everyone just accepting their fate and still managing to live life as if it were the easiest game you could play? Meanwhile there's me, who, without his family and (luckily) very supportive school/the few friends I have, would have ended up wrapped around a tree four years ago already? I can't do this anymore.

Commong friends have givene a quick update on my depressed ex gf. Or what I thought was my 'depressed gf' : my (apparently) depressed ex gf is happy as ever! 

What I though was depression seemed to be disconfort in our relationship, as she is apparently extremely happy since we broke up. 

We were together for 2 years and had our ups and donws. I tried to help her through what appeared to be a depression, asucb as I could. She eventually started taking antidepressants and anxiolitics 6 month ago, and that helped a bit, the meds were from a gp. Finally she started seeing a psychiatrist, and after a session, she realized she couldn't do it anymore with me. 

1 month later I hear that she is doing extremely well, having an amazing social life and is of off her meds. She didn't tell her psychiatrist apparently and took the decision herself..... I am not a gp, but I thought this was dangerous...

275,I want to give up....,"I'm exhausted. 
I'm only 17 and it feels really stupid to write this out and I know that literally everyone I know will tell me that this is just a phase and that it will pass by, but I'm not so sure. 
   I feel like I keep myself alive out of an obligation. An obligation to my only 3 friends to not hurt them even more, an obligation to my grandparents to achieve what the hope of me, an obligation to all my teachers, mentors who have had faith in me, an obligation to my cousins to stick around and to be there for them, an obligation to my nephew to be a good role model and most of all out of an obligation to my parents, to not let them down, to not fail, to not give up.

   I’m from an average upper middle class family and grew up in a great home. When I look back I see the great childhood I experienced. I was pretty smart as a kid grew up quickly. So everyone is quick to assume that I'm fine on my own. That I'll be able to manage anything and survive gracefully in any situation.

     But the truth is that everything feels like an uphill battle for me. It feels like to reach 100 everyone starts at 0, but I somehow start at -100. It's been really hard for me to do the most simple things like pulling myself out of my bed and taking a shower. And even with all this I have no choice but to compete in that same rat race as everyone else.

    Growing up I realized that every time I acted like myself or tried to voice my real issues and problems I'd get overlooked or dismissed or even worse bullied. So I just resorted to never talking about my problems and constantly acting like I'm 'normal’ just to make other people around me comfortable. And now I feel as if by doing that I've lost a part of me that I'll never get back.

      I have so much shit constantly going on in my head that I can't get anything done right. And I hate that. I'm so tired of trying hard and I just want to give up. But then again I feel guilty about wanting to give up because of my obligations. I truly do not know what to do anymore…

278,I feel I have no right to be depressed.,"I feel as though I have no right to be depressed. I come from a privileged background. Both parents are immigrants (Haiti) who worked their butts off to provide for my older brother and I throughout our lives. He's 22 turning 23 and I'm 18 turning 19 this year. We have a younger brother but he's barely conscious of the world yet (he turns 5 in a couple of days). Whatever, I'm rambling.

What the hell have I gone through to feel this way every day? I've been bullied since elementary school, I have trouble socializing and making friends. I've never felt like I've belonged anywhere. Turns out I'm autistic; got diagnosed last year. That's no reason to feel that way, though? My parents don't argue or abuse us. The most I have trouble with is the strained relationship with my dad. I feel as though he was physically there but not emotionally. I barely remember anything good from before the age of 13, but I remember a lot of bad experiences. My parents constantly calling me disrespectful, saying I talk too much, that I talk back too much, being hit out of discipline, and the time each of them called me annoying. According to my mom, my dad and I had a really good relationship when I was younger but I have no recollection of this. They took us on road trips a lot with our cousins but I have no memory of anything. I've just become indifferent with my entire family. My dog feels like the only thing for me, sometimes, but he's getting old. Turns 13 in a few months. I can barely hold a job down for more than 2 months. Worked at Taco Bell and I hated it. Got a good job with Amazon as a helper but I quit because workplace drama and I said something that got twisted into something worse. They said I could stay but I couldn't go back there after that. I say things and people interpret it the complete other way. 

I've been to the mental hospital 4 times in 2024 in the span of 3-4 months. 3 times at the same facility and once at a residential. I feel like such an emotional and financial burden on my family. I wish they didn't love me so I could have an excuse to feel the resentment. I just feel like a spoiled brat complaining about nothing.

It feels like my mind is at war with itself constantly. It's so frustrating. I've become so apathetic now. People tell me my face barely changes. I've started smoking weed every now and then through a friend and it feels like the only thing that helps. Everything else is just so gray. I'm everyone else's friend but no one except 2 people are MY friends. In my first semester of college and it's so gray, man. Things just feel so dull, now.

279,Socializing,"Honestly I don’t know what’s wrong with me and why I feel pain and suffering from the simplest things, but it is a fact that you can’t escape suffering in life. If social skills are a recipe that most people get used to, then I feel like I have to cook from scratch every interaction without a recipe. I can’t make eye contact with people, I have a flat affect, I’m ugly as shit and intimidating to look at, have no charisma or personality, and I feel extreme dissociation and tension in any social setting. If I could just socialize normally I feel like my life wouldn’t be so bad. It’s not even that I feel incredibly lonely (which I do), but my social anxiety and ineptitude gets in the way of so many more things in my life, from learning in lectures to collaborating at work to just buying things at the grocery store. 

I already stopped relying on motivation or passion to do basic shit for myself and to advance my personal goals. Getting through life on my own isn’t as bad because I’m just battling against myself. I’m honestly glad I figured this out because I used to be way worse: I wouldn’t do basic hygiene or chores for days and weeks, I was fat and lazy, ate like shit, and had terrible insomnia. In many respects my life has improved immensely. But it just keeps eating away at me how uncomfortable I make other people because of how horribly socialized I am. I keep working towards better social skills even though it physically hurts and I feel like a pathetic loser because of it. I just hate that other people have to interact with the social experiment that is me.

285,I don't feel like I am in control of myself,"It feels so disappointing when other people point out your behavior, the things you do wrong, thinking or believing that you just... did the wrong things. But sometimes it's so much more complex than that.

I know, I am aware, I am conscious of all the wrong things I do, but even so, I still do them, and when i realize that I've done them, it feels like my body wasn't mine for a while. It feels like I was possessed by something who doesn't care about the consequences of my actions, and I hate that person, because I am that person. I don't have DID, i wasn't possessed by a ghost, or mind controlled by anything. I just behaved like a piece of shit for some amonut of time, for some unknown reason. I don't even know why.

I just want to have some agency. To be able to say ""Today I will do this"" and do it. Because right now it's difficult to do even if there are no distractions/interferences in the day, it still feels impossible to do what I should sometimes.

What am I even saying. This is my first post of the day, after a relatively calm week just because I messed up a few times and I can't bear the thought of disappointing the people who believe in me yet I do not believe in myself one bit. What is wrong with me ? Sometimes I just want to walk in a direction and not stop until I fall of exhaustion, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up, I just want it all to stop, because my brain cannot. i can't think about nothing, i can't ever truly relax, I can't quit my bad habit, and I can't convince anyone that I'm really trying, what's the point of being alive then if I'll never be able to do anything that I actually want ?

I had goals, I had dreams, I had ambitions, but now these are all out the window. i see everybody going forward and I can't take one step. It's like we're all in life pushing a boulder and I have the tiniest one but it's made of fucking adamantium or some shit which makes it impossible to budge. Everybody pushes forward, I can't push 1 inch. That's not what life is supposed to be. At my age, usually you start working, you figure out how you want to live your life, or you already did. I don't even know if I'll be alive in the next five years, because I don't have any certainty about anything concerning me and it's terrifying. I don't want to be so fucking terrified of everything, I want to go, to stop, to do something but I can't, and it's not that i haven't tried, I just can not. My mind, my soul, my body won't let me, but i know I want to. This is so fucking unfair.

A bunch of fucking idiots who are weaker, dumber, smaller, younger than I am are going ahead and look at me, unable to do a single fucking thing. 

Is somebody here ? Is it even worth carrying on ? Should I just buy a rope and stool ? I don't want to keep thinking about all of this anymore. I just want to rest my mind once and for all. I'm too scared, and I am a coward, I don't deserve any better anyway.

Eveerybody keeps saying the opposite, but they know so little. They weren't there when my mom died, they weren't there all of the time beforre that where I spent days in bed because I couldn't muster the energy to act upon anything, they weren't there when i realised just how much I regressed because of depression, they weren't there each and every time the weight of my failures caught up to me and crushed me. So many times I couldn't breath, i couldn't talk, I couldn't think because i was overwhelm by the realization of the sheer mediocrity that is my life. I'm nothing, I've never been anything and I'll never be anything. It'll be a miracle if I'm still alive by 25, and I don't believe in miracles anymore. I counted on my future self so many times before and I've done nothing but disappoint myself at every possible occasion. I don't deserve life. My life was way too easy for me to feel this way.

Somebody else should come and take my place. Somebody competent, useful, and determined, because that isn't me.

Fuck, nobody's even gonna read this. Why am I still typing for ? I know how pointless this is, yet this is the only thing that brings me even a little bit of relief. My mom would hate me if she saw me. Everybody would hate me if they truly knew me. Dying seems so comforting.

287,Mentally done!,"I don’t know what to do. I want to die, but I can’t do it because of my family.

You might have read stories about middle-class families, but have you ever read about lower-class families? I have written my story as shortly as I can.

My family consists of my brother, mother, younger brother (who is in 10th grade), and sister who is about to complete +2. I am 21 years old, and my elder brother is 23. I work as a videographer in a advertising company. I am a fresher, and my salary is 12k Indian money (140$)

My brother went to the Gulf as a student when he was 20. he spent all his earnings and sent back only enough to cover the family’s expenses.

My father (in my life mostly hated person) left us seven years ago (not because he passed away, but because he abandoned us). Since then, our family’s situation has worsened. My family and I have had to endure more than we could handle. While everyone else in the family owns their own house, we are the only ones still living in a run-down house that looks like it could collapse at any time. It would probably top the list of the worst houses in our hometown.

My father never provided us with what we needed. He didn’t buy us a house. He didn’t give us a proper education. My brother and I only completed +2. Although I went to college, I had to drop out after three months because financial struggles became unbearable. After that, I started working, saved some money, and studied videography( my passion). My elder brother completed +2 but couldn’t continue his studies due to financial difficulties. He had to work different jobs just to survive.

If you ask me about my biggest dream in life, I would say it is to have a small house for my family to live in. My mother always says, “I just want to live in my own house before I die.” She has suffered so much since birth—always struggling, always in poverty, never getting a chance to live a peaceful life.

I had two relationships in the past, but when they heard my story, they left me. They are right because no point in being with someone from such a poor family.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t have a house. My sister is about to complete +2 and is growing up. My younger brother will be in +1 next year. I feel like I’m going crazy. Even though my salary is 12k, after EMI and loan repayments, my expenses come to 20K. And if I add the loans we had to take just for household expenses, the total debt is overwhelming.

Iam Thinking about all this, I feel mentally exhausted. How can i start from zero?

290,Fuck my brain,"I am 17m, on the spectrum, and doing homeschooling and I have absolutely no friends. I used to do public school but my mental health got so bad I had to start doing it where I felt much more comfortable. School everyday was like literal hell. It was one of the things that drove me to the point of actually trying to end my life. so I eventually had to do inpatient care for a while. Now, it wasn’t my only problem, but being near people all fucking day with no friends and absolutely no one to spend my time with was just the icing on the cake. Like I was actually sitting alone at lunch in a school of 1500+ people. I just wanted to feel some sort of connection with ANYONE. But, i ended up not having any friends at all for 2 years at this school. As you could assume I feel lonely 24/7 and I don’t know what to do about it. I’m extremely socially awkward and afraid to step out of my comfort zone, but I know there are people like me with friends. I mean honestly I just felt like the problem. Was I scary looking? Ugly? seemed to boring? I just don’t get why people wouldn’t talk to me. But Anyways as I stated earlier I don’t have any friends at all. Basically every time I dream it’s about having friends or meeting this girl who doesn’t exist. I know they aren’t real, but the experiences feel so real and so good when i’m in them. It’s like my life did a 360 and I finally have people that seem to care about me and notice I exist. Idk, I just wish I wouldn’t wake up from these dreams. Like, why do I have to come back to my shit life in the real world every single time. It just hurts so bad, living a life you view as being perfect. Then boom the next second going back to actual reality. the best part, I cry after every single one of these dreams (if it weren’t for these id be crying like once a decade.

this is long and i don’t really expect strangers on the internet to read it, but im just so lost. 

i don’t know where to begin, what to say, what to do. i don’t know how to convey just how deeply unhappy i am, but ill try. 

i was diagnosed with depression when i was a kid. due to personal circumstances, it started young, but it has never been this bad. 2020 was the start of this downward trend. it was a major, traumatic death. without giving too many details, i saw someone i love die and still feel a lot of guilt about what happened. some things you can’t unsee. it was hard, and it still is, but i was functioning well enough and had spots of happiness here and there throughout the following few years. fast forward to 2024— this past year has been, by far, without a doubt, the worst of my life, and i thought it couldn’t get any worse than watching a loved one die suddenly. 

2024 saw the deaths of not 1, not 2, not even 3, but 8 family members. it felt like we were going to a funeral every week. just when you feel like you have begun to process one death and can start the actual grieving, another one died. one after another after another. and one of the worst parts of it was the absolute dread of “who’s next?” i am not exaggerating when i tell you i texted my mom every 20 minutes to make sure she was alive, for months and months. and i still do, but less frequently. now ive gone down to every couple hours. 

and ive been in this cycle of self sabotage. i left my job in 2021 to focus on a more career-focused pathway. as it turns out— what i was so sure i wanted to do isn’t something i can tolerate in its current state. it wore me down physically, mentally, emotionally. i did as much as i could, but i was so overwhelmed that i had to go on leave for 3 months. i tried to go back, but i couldn’t. once my 3 months were up, i put in my two weeks. i was so lost. i thought i was finally on track to getting my life together. i figured out what i wanted to do and how to do it. i worked my ass off as a part time college student while working in the environment my degree would have me in. i was getting great experience. but the experience wasn’t great. it was horrendous. i was crushed. it was back to square one. 

i took a year off work but continued school. 

the first death was at the end of 2023, just before christmas. very sudden. should not have happened. holiday was hard but we got through. next month, january, lost two more. both sudden, unexpected, shouldn’t have happened. march, nothing, just the constant terror of not knowing who was next. then april, and this was probably the absolute worst because this is what led me to my biggest and most painful regret. my best friends mom died. she was my second mom. they were my second family. she died, as the others did, very suddenly. she was on vacation in a foreign country with just my best friend with her. my heart breaks that he had to go through that, and so far from home too and he couldn’t even come back right away to be with his dad and sisters. he came home, alone, about a week after.

a bunch of his family and friends and i went to his house to support him. i should never have gone. i don’t know WHAT came over me, or WHAT i was thinking. i very rarely drink, and its even rarer for me to drink until im drunk, but that’s exactly what i did. like it was a fucking PARTY. like what the actual fuck is wrong with me? i guess i was trying to bring the spirits up a bit, trying to be happy and put out a positive energy. but i overdid it, and i destroyed my relationship with his family. he’s still my best friend and he has forgiven me, but i am no longer part of the family, and i miss them so so much. i regret what i did every single day. nothing has ever hurt as much as this has.

and then the rest of 2024 saw 4 more family deaths. i left school without graduating and got a new job in a field im interested in. 

i was in therapy the whole time, and i was medicated, but nothing helped. i told her i was done. and all she said was “good luck.” i don’t know what i expected when i told her i was through, but it definitely wasn’t that. i gave up on myself, but somehow i didn’t realize how easy it was for people to give up on me too, especially someone who tried so hard to help me. it’s probably unreasonable of me to be hurt by that, but i am.

now— every day is the same. i go to work, i come home, i sit on the couch and do what the fuck ever to pass the time. sometimes i watch tv, other times i write, other times i play video games. but i don’t enjoy it. it’s just something to occupy myself before i have to go to bed and do it all over again. with barely anyone left in my family and my ruined relationship with my second family, i have never felt so alone. and with how profound this sadness and anger and apathy is, ive pushed the few people i have away, even my mom.

i’m doing this to myself. i’ve left my therapist. i’ve left school. i’ve cut off everyone but my mom and my best friend, and even with them i feel so distant. i talk to them about what im feeling, but im incapable of being comforted. i just get angry and frustrated. i lash out when they are trying to help me feel better. i’m so angry all the time. i’m so sad all the time. and i can’t escape this overwhelming feeling of boredom and hopelessness. i don’t see much a point to anything. i’m just existing, and there’s nothing that brings me joy. sure there are happy moments here and there, but that’s all they are, just little moments. 

all i want is to vanish, move somewhere far away, and never think about this life again. but that’s expensive and i don’t have a degree. i left college. more than once. i’m turning 30. i feel so childish, so incapable, so lost, like i am just inherently wrong. and i don’t see how anything can get better. i don’t want to do this anymore. i’m so done. i won’t kill myself, but i don’t want to be alive. with any luck im terminally ill and my days are numbered. 

if you’ve read this, im sorry. thank you for letting me vent.

293,Am I depressed?,"I can't tell if I'm depressed. Or at least have a right to be depressed. 

My life to most people is pretty much perfect. My parents love me, my sisters love me, my fiancé loves me. I graduated from a good university in December and passed my board exam and can officially start working as a licensed nurse.

The job I have now pays well and requires minimal effort. I make more than my fiancé doing basically nothing.

My parents have provided me with everything. I still live with them and they bought me my car and paid for all of my school expenses. I have absolutely no debt thanks to them. Anything I want, I can basically get and truly I am not suffering when it comes to having my daily living needs met.

I don't really have any medically issues except for occasional migraines and IBS.

I was 11 years old when I first felt truly isolated. As in, lonely, even when there were people around me. I thought it was because I was having friendship issues, but even at that age I thought it wouldn't last and I'd make new friends in middle school. But middle school is when I knew I had depression, because it followed me everywhere I went. I hated middle school. The people there were immature and cruel. The quiet kids got bullied and people judged you off of the brands you wore and phone you had. I was ready to leave as soon as I arrived, because I was a new student at the time. I started looking up charter schools and private schools, where I though I would fit in better. Unfortunately, I couldn't control where I went to school, and had to put up with it.

When high school started, I was sure things would get better. I applied to a exclusive high school and got selected to be a part of a graduating class of only 75 students. I thought this would be better for me. But even then life still seemed so gray. Everyone was always so happy and cheerful, and I could not relate. But I didn't know why. It felt like my eyes opened at the age of 11 and never saw life the same way again.

So now I'm 21, 10 years of feeling something that I'm not sure I can even call depression. Just pessimistic of everything? Or low? I have felt happiness, but it's been very fleeting. Or even when I am having a good time, I know that, that is not my baseline and I will always return to feeling, empty? I think that's a good word for it.

When my boyfriend proposed, I said yes because I wouldn't want to be with anyone else. He knows my baggage. And he's accepted that part of me. I've told my parents, and they said I have nothing to be depressed for, and I know they're right. My sisters said they relate, and I can actually tell that they do. My older sister went through the same thing growing up and told my dad she hated her life. I can see my younger sister going through the same thing. As a former nursing student I began to wonder maybe it was genetic?

My parents have also been very tough on my sisters and I, and particularly me. And at times that exacerbates my feeling of hopelessness, but I know it's because I've already been feeling hopeless. I love my parents, even when they made mistakes on how to raise me.

School was very challenging for me, but it was a great distraction from my thoughts. I guess that's why I seemed very studious and got good grades.

Now that I have graduated it's time for me to get a job with my degree. However, I have reached somewhat of a breaking point. I have lost all motivation. School was the only thing I knew how to keep myself distracted with so I didn't seem depressed. But now that's over. I'm thinking about getting my doctorates so I don't end up doing something I regret. I often fantasize about ending things, but I know it would do more harm than good.

I was supposed to get married this month, but now it seems like too much effort. I should be going to interviews, but that also seems like too much effort. Lastly, my fiancé and I wanted to move in together, but lately I've been preferring to rot in bed at my parent's house and eat fast food and sweets. My hygiene is questionable, but it's always been. I don't like taking showers or brushing my teeth because it's too much effort. I do it once a week to maintain my appearance when out, but when I'm home, I couldn't care less. My room is currently a mess, and I could clean it, but what's the point if I don't even leave my bed. I know this all points to depression, but I just don't understand why I would be depressed. Everyone goes through hardships in life, that's normal. And I have gone through many hardships, but I feel even if I hadn't, I would still be this way.

I want to get better but I don't even know where to start if I don't have a actual reason. I just am. So maybe I'm not depressed. Maybe I'm just a lazy, unhygienic, girl.

304,52 years of numbness,"I’ve tried hard to pull myself out of this pit. I’ve known since early childhood that I wasn’t meant for this world. Emotionally, verbal and physical abuse started when I was young. Couldn’t make friends and was just a loser. 

I started cutting when I was young to just feel something, anything. I was at least in charge of that. My family couldn’t or didn’t want to understand why I wore jeans and long sleeves even in 110 degree weather. I think my daughter is suspicious of my cutting but neither of us have brought it up. 

I now have tattoos to cover the scars. But mentally I’m about as bad as I’ve ever been. 

I never even opened up to my ex wife of 25 years even though I tried suicide several times. The last time, I drank a bottle of Jim Beam while out ice fishing and sat out in -20 weather. It felt so good as my life slipped away. I was so relaxed and happy that I was going to be successful in taking my life. 

Well, that didn’t happen. Somebody found me and paramedics rushed me to the hospital. I woke up in the hospital and everyone telling me how lucky I was to be alive. I was furious and had to hide it again. 

My wife divorced me and now I’m on track to attempt again. I will go even more remote this time and hope nobody finds me until I’ve been successful. 

I’ve got everything in order. Bills paid, kids put on bank accounts, dog will be taken care of. My mom will think it’s just an accident.

306,How do I get home back?,"Not sure if this is the right place to post. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for four years. Due to financial circumstances, he lives with his female best friend—who also happens to be his ex. He has assured me that their relationship is purely platonic, but I recently discovered that she doesn’t even know I exist.

He has told me that we can’t be together yet because I’m not financially stable, and I’m doing my best to change that. However, he spends time with her doing things that feel like normal couple activities—attending family gatherings, going out together—while I only see him on weekends.

Lately, I’ve been feeling incredibly lonely and insecure. In a moment of weakness, I downloaded a dating app, I deleted it immediately, just wanted  to have someone to talk to and vent my feelings. I should have expressed my emotions to him instead, and I deeply regret my actions. I know it was wrong, and I feel ashamed. I don’t have any family or friends to talk this with. I feel so depressed. I’m extremely suicidal. I haven’t eaten or slept in days. 

He found out about the app, even though I never used it, because he regularly checks my phone—something I never do with his. Now, he is in a lot of pain and doesn’t know how to move forward. He hasn’t said he wants to end things, but he feels lost and hurt. The problem is, we’ve never had an open and honest conversation about our insecurities, and I feel like that’s what led to this situation.

I’m also deeply worried about his well-being, as he seems emotionally overwhelmed. I don’t know how to help him, how to rebuild his trust, or how to move on from this. I love him I want to make it work. The only way it might work is if I get a higher paying job, I’m trying my best, I recently got a job promotion, but that still wasn’t enough for us to be together.

312,I am afraid of being alone and travelling alone but it´s my dream,"Hey everyone,

I want to share my story with you so that it´s out there & may motivate someone.  
I have a depression since 4 months heavily and before in milder forms for over half of my life. I am 30 now. I had to endure a lot of childhood traumas, which recently all came back up again, plus I am before my final exam at university studying law, which is very tough in Germany. Then I just went through a breakup with my girlfriend and best friend. We still live together which is not easy and she tried to help me & did not just ran away. We are working on our friendship which needs time. She will leave in 2 months and go travel the world to fulfill her dream. I wanted to go with her and still want to. But first we need some time I guess. I am finishing my studies this year and then be ready to go. I save up some money right now. Before I tried to manage it all together but honestly I failed. It was just too much. One thing alone is too much but everything together was just enormous amounts of pressure. I never thought I would be at such a point but here I am and I don´t run away. I embrace it. But I am just sick of feeling that way.   
The only thing that helps me right now is my long term vision, zooming out into the dream I have. That keeps me alive. Building a good, better life that is worth living.   
I am afraid of travelling alone for a while and being alone soon. I never learned it but now I have to.   
I will visit her and fulfill my dream, but right now I need all that energy.

317,I feel like I’m in a death spiral,"
Good morning. Long rant here, so buckle up, if you’re interested.


Life has never dealt me the best hand. It’s always felt like one step forward, two steps back. There are still good days when the weight lifts a bit, and I can find some enjoyment. Im Glad I’m privileged enough to have parents who allow me to  stay at their house, even though I contribute to the rent (it’s only fair). and for my family members who still love like my sister who understands me better (even though I don’t tell her everything), my parents don’t understand mental health. 

But many days if not most, I feel myself losing grip on reality, I lack the motivation to fight for or better myself. Many times, I have no motivation to even do the things I enjoy like playing a stupid video game. I'm amazed that I manage to get out of bed and go to work each morning, especially with the constant lack of sleep. It's almost a miracle. 

I often feel worthless and question if things will ever get better. It only seems to be getting worse. I feel like I've accomplished nothing in life, and all I've done is be a burden. I'm lost.

I struggle to see any good in myself. I dislike who I am and what I look like. My body, my teeth, and my condition including NF1 are constant reminders of my flaws. I’m a mess.

I still live with my parents, stuck in dead-end jobs, without a car or license. I have no real hobbies, just video games, doomscrolling, and too much pornography. I feel pathetic and believe I have no redeeming qualities. I'm insecure, unworthy of love and friendship, and struggled academically.

Loneliness exacerbates my feelings. While I have family, I haven't had face-to-face friends for over a decade, only one online friend whom I cherish and I’ve never experienced romantic love.

Although I'm not officially diagnosed, it sure feels like I'm battling depression and anxiety. I have episodes of panic, worthlessness, and hopelessness that leave me wanting to hide away from the world. I question if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are even valid.

I’m not suicidal, I don’t want to die and death is probably my greatest fear. But the intrusive thoughts of just “not existing” are there, always looming over me. I'm terrified that one day I’ll crash, and it's not a matter of if, but when.

I’m just really tired of it all. Why couldn’t I have been somebody else? Fuck me, man…

A part of me didn’t want to post this but another just needed to throw out to get something off my chest. 

I just don’t  know what to do, it’s all so overwhelming.

318,I think I’m better off dead.,"I think I’m better off dead.

I don’t know how to say this without sounding dramatic, but I feel like a burden to everyone — my friends, my family, even myself. It’s exhausting waking up every day feeling like I’m just taking up space, like I’m more of a problem than a person. I try to push through, but the weight of it all just keeps building, and honestly, I don’t know how much longer I can pretend I’m okay.

I’m not sure why I’m even posting this. I guess I just needed to tell someone — anyone — because holding it in feels impossible. I’m tired of feeling like this, and I’m tired of feeling guilty for feeling like this.

I don’t know what to do.

328,The bliss of acceptance.,"Will be ending my life here in the next few days. This is the closest of ever been to suicide i think, and it's crazy how calm I feel. Ive heard people preach about acceptance my entire life but could never grasp it. Until now. I finally accepted that I am not meant for this world. 

There is one thing I've wanted in my life and I was never able to get it. I just wanted love. And to have someone I was allowed to love. It could've been my mother, or any of my siblings, or a friend or a girlfriend.  I just wanted someone. I have loved before. In fact, I am loving right now. But the people I love do not want my love. And they never have. I can't place my finger on why. Was there something innately wrong with me? Idk. Seemed like it. But I spent most of my years trying to figure it out, but came up with nothing tangible. 

I tried to change who I was to conform into what people were telling me someone would want out.of a friend or a partner. But that didn't work. I was told being too nice was a bad thing. And it showed that I didn't respect myself.  But, I respected myself enough to do what I wanted and what I wanted was to be as helpful as I could. It was not on me to determine who actually needed help and who was just taking advantage of me. Cause I had the compacity to help them all. 

I was also told things like it was wrong for me to want connections. And that I should be fine with being by myself. But I don't think the people who say that have ever been truly alone for any extended period of time. Or maybe they have, and they're just wired differently. Doesn't change the fact that i am not content alone. 

For most of my life, I was told I would need to change who I was to be able to be succeed in this  world. But even when pretending to be something I wasn't, I wasn't able to get the one thing I wanted. I could do anything else I tried to do. But not the one thing I actually wanted. 

And now, being able to accept that has has set me free. If i think back on it. I think the only reason I have survived this far, is the sunken cost fallacy.  I kept thinking that I had already suffered so much, and already made it this far, so it would be a shame to end it now. But with this new acceptance. I'm finally able to put my foot down and stop the suffering. 

But anyway. Just wanted to get my thoughts out there. Hopefully it helps someone, or atleast entertains. Will likely end it sometime this weekend. Just will wait until it feels right. But I can tell it's coming soon. ",4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1iuh87u/the_bliss_of_acceptance/,Objective_Soft_5566,1740108138.0,depression

330,I Need Advice.,"The thoughts I say I'll never act upon sound more and more welcoming as the days go by. I feel like the only thing tying me down is the guilt I feel toward those I would be leaving.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at a young age and thrown on all sorts of medication, but most did more harm than good or just made me numb and indifferent—which can be nice at times, but life starts to slip away from you. I lived the same day over and over for so long that I forgot how to socialize, set goals, or love. I just feel like I have no value.

So I did something about it. I've been in therapy, jumping through all sorts of hoops to ""feel better,"" but I still feel the same, if not worse. I've had multiple therapists—some a lot worse than others—but my current therapist is amazing. Even so, I just can't improve, and I hate waking up every single day.

I've been thinking about checking myself into a mental hospital because I genuinely don't feel safe around myself in this state. It's manageable—stressful and miserable, but manageable—until that one little thing sets me off. Last time something like that happened, I almost jumped off a building. That was just last week. This episode has lasted over two weeks now.

I've heard so many negative things about inpatient care, especially ER crisis visits. I also have a deep fear of doctors—they’ve given me severe anxiety my entire life. I feel like such a loser for even writing this, and I doubt anyone will even see it. I just want advice.

I have so much I want to say, but it just feels like a waste of time. If going to a mental hospital means I get real help, someone to talk to, and a safe, comfortable environment, I'm okay with that. But my biggest fear is that they’ll just isolate me for 72 hours without actually helping. I'm scared I'll leave with new trauma, worse than before, with new lore to randomly drop on people.

I really wish he would change his mind and just find the right woman to start a family with but I don't think he ever will.He never seems to want to be in a relationship for more than a few months even when he was younger

I really believe he would be a great dad and his kids would most likely look like angels

My middle son has had the same gf for years but they have both been adamant on being child free which hurts so much

338,I am scared like really scared,"
So, I have a few concerns which are giving me peak anxiety and idk how to proceed and I’m 22 so yes literally young and dumb but still just need someone to tell me it’ll be okay. 

A bit of background on me I’m the cousin/friend who everyone is compared to. Straight As, currently working at this big ass job which is the highest pay anyone from my uni was offered after undergrad, didn’t seem fun enough so now going to UCL in September. I’m extroverted and like extremely extroverted and my family is rich and like real rich and we have this huge business and trust fund which ensures that even if I don’t live a finger I can still live an extremely comfortable life. 

Im not particularly attractive or anything but I’ve always had girls around me. Had two serious relationships, cheated on them, they didn’t find out but ended things because of different reason, had people fawning over me cause i was always in a leadership position. Headboy, student council chair, general secretary you name it, had an amazing social life but now at my workplace I have nothing. No flashy social life, no cool friends, no constant partying, no dating the prettiest girl, no hooking up with every attractive woman.

The change happened because I started this job (the one mentioned earlier) and I don’t have time to socialise anymore and I knew my life was superficial but now that I have actually lost everything I feel done. I mean I would probably be able to do it all again at UCL but what’s the fucking point. It’ll still be a house of cards and will shatter the second I step out! I have real friends but they’re away and I’m a very chaotic person I move almost every 6 months making new friends and new connections. Novelty is the crux of my life and I get bored easily with everything and it is my truth so I just feel like giving up and ending it all. Idk this phase feels soo enlightening like a fucking slap in the face that life is just depressing with a few happy moments here and there. I wanna chase something real this time and cut all the bullshit but idk man idk how the world works how it will be. It feels like nothing makes me happy anymore and I don’t even know who I am. My therapist asked me who are you truly if we remove everything superficial and I honestly said I’m nobody! Is that how it will be that I can just get 10 seconds of happiness and 10 months of reality check for the rest of my life? Is life really that sad? I see all these girls posting cheating on their partners and I see the Reddit stories about lies and cheating and it just makes me wonder that the dream of just being with my person and everything is just some wild fantasy that won’t become a reality! And that fear alone has made me this way. I wanna trust again I wanna fall in love I want something real but it feel like the world is a real fucked up place and I’ll never ever ever ever amount to anything real or have something real and it’s just a constant fuckry!

She continued to tell me that not every problem can be resolved by therapy and at some point I will need to be satisfied with the progress I have made. She spend another 10 minutes talking me out of seeing my phychology when I have never spoken with her about my mental health issues. She had student doctor sitting in on the appointment and I felt humiliated. It had been a really big struggle of mine in the past as I have had my own mother tell me I am worth less because I am ""broken"" and need to see a phychologist. I don't know what to do.

342,My little sister is dying.,"Hi. 
My little sister has overcome 2 rare cancer diagnosis in her short life and now has another that she (pushing past my consistent optimism) will not. She has a third diagnosis and after months of chemo, immunotherapy, and an unapproved trial drug, her tumors have grown. Right now, she has a super rare bile duct cancer with many mutations that has spread across her belly as well as a massive malignant tumor in her liver 14cm long. 

I have always had severe depression. ECT many many times over, every medication under the sun, plus a new diagnosis of panic disorder. I am stuck. Stuck on the couch. Crying. Hating myself. Wanting out. No balls to do so. 

I can’t manage living as a functioning adult but I’m trying. My wife has become more and more resentful of me. I don’t clean enough, work enough, do enough, she cooks. Believe me, I think about these things more than anyone could. I know I’m not pulling my weight. I tell her I know and understand. I’m sinking. I feel just empty. She yells at me to do something for her. I tell her I understand. I will do better. I don’t.

I keep my job, look after my children, house ect I am in therapy but early stages so at the moment I feel worse as we are timelining rather than being proactive about coping mechanisms. I have these bouts of I call them depression waves where I just can't do anything but cry and usually these happen when I'm alone and I can mange it myself but recently since I started the therapy it's started happening when I'm with my boyfriend and I need tools to be able to handle it. I'm guessing that my brain and body feel safe and comfortable with him which is why it happens when I'm with him now rather than when I'm on my own but as you can imagine it causes a real strain on our relationship it's hard to be there with someone when they are just crying and crying.

i’m envious of it. i wish i could be like them, have direction, genuinely care, but i just can’t. i don’t see the point in anything i do unless it’s for someone else, and even then, it’s not that i care about making them happy — it’s just guilt and obligation. 

i feel so confused all the time. i just want things to be simpler and quieter. i want things to feel warm and sweet, but life isn’t like that. it’s just so overwhelming being alive.

I couldn't escape his sins. I reign the only person in my family who didnt have a criminal record, not so much as a parking ticket. I also remained the only 1 who didnt ask for anything. But remained hated anyways.

I left an open communication channel for them to come to me with anything, I've offered ky home, my heart, my money, my life, and none of it was of any value to them. I've almost succeeded killing myself many times but my husband saved me each time. 

I've spent so many days aching and hurting, i feel myself slipping away, but i can't do it anymore. I'm following my therapists advice and deleting all my social media, every avenua i left open fo them. Its not fair to my husband and his family that i spend every holiday staring at my phone for an ounce of affection from them. So on the 27th, after I've posted my playlist, and I've said my peace i will delete it all. I will let them go, so i can start living. 

I cant waste another day dead inside, i can't waste another minute not talking to my family... my real family of strangers who took me in and cared for me when no 1 else would. I will let go of all of them. And never look back, because the world won't wait for me, and i have found the 1 thing I've prayed for since a kid a family.

357,I’m worried my boyfriend is about to give up on me,"I moved into his house in a small mountain town back in October after being long distance for a while. I had a pretty full and happy life back in my hometown, but we didn’t want to be long distance anymore and my job is remote anyway. 

I kind of struggled immediately but things got really bad recently with me coming very close to ending it (I currently regret not just doing it while I had the chance). I’ve had pretty rough PTSD (treated with therapy a few years back and have been mostly good since then), but I’ve never been this low/dark. Every bad interaction feels like proof I shouldn’t be alive. There have been a lot of bad interactions because I am being frustrating and he’s tired of trying to reassure me. 

He got me into weekly therapy that started last week and I just started meds this morning. I’m supposed to get bloodwork results back tomorrow for a vitamin D deficiency or anything else that might be causing it. I am trying to want to live. 

I feel like he’s completely over me being like this, and I don’t blame him - I can’t imagine this is fun for him either. But I love him and I live in his house in a small town I never would have moved to on my own - I don’t want him to kick me out or give up on me when I am trying to take steps to be better. 

I don’t want to lose him. I want to be okay. How can I ask him to be patient while I do treatment? Is that even fair or reasonable to ask? Should I just be packing up and leaving for his benefit? Knowing that I am making him miserable makes me regret not just following through last week. I’m afraid he’s never going to love me again anyway.

she lost a loved one three years ago and hasn't been the same since. she takes high doses of antidepressants every day and self-harms herself, talks about wanting to die. she also disrupts her therapy. and when i or our mutual friends bring up this issue, she distance herself from us. 

the thing is, I've never been depressed (or suicidal) in my entire life, so I don't know how to help her in a situation like this. i try my best, but i think it's not enough. 

her father does not know that she is in such a bad situation, should I share this with her father? What if this makes things worse? because i think they love each other, but there is no solid bond between them.

380,Happy but wouldn’t mind dying,"Just ranting on here because I can’t figure out why I think and feel this way. 

I’m 28F, living in LA, pretty happy with my life, I like my job and am grateful to work for a great company, I love my family (I do struggle with my relationship with my father), have a few good friends, and I’m generally considered pretty. Which are all great things, but  it doesn’t change my mind about how I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow. 

Yes, I used to be very suicidal years ago, but I am on Wellbutrin and haven’t felt suicidal at all recently, and have a therapist that I see once a week. It’s just I would prefer to die if I got the chance. I used to look at pictures of a lake in Italy, and think “oh I need to check it out before I die” , but now I’m more like indifferent if I don’t see the lake in my life time. And I do feel a little bit sad accepting that I feel fine not seeing the lake in Italy, but I really wouldn’t mind anymore.

I do not want to actively kill myself, but I don’t want to exist. It’s such a weird feeling. 

Obviously, I don’t want to feel this way and know that this isn’t normal… what’s wrong with me and how do I help it??

382,Just a rant,"Just here to rant cause I know that nothing that anyone will tell me will help how I am. Compared to a lot of peoples lives who are on here, this is probably nothing. Especially because I just turned 18, so apparently I know nothing of what it's like to actually feel any sort of bad feelings. I just flunked out of school today, and it was online school so it was most definitely, the easiest thing I could have done but I still didn't make it. I didn't pass because I'm lazy, and cocky, and a coward. I didn't pass and it's all my fault. I am going to continue the cycle of nowthree generations of my family to flunk out of school. My mother and my grandmother didn't graduate because they were teen moms, but I have no excuse as to why I didn't make it. My family is poor, we live in a 2 bedroom apartment for 5 (sometimes 7) people, we are unhealthy, my brother is an asshole to me all the time, and it's always dirty here (which is again, my own fault). The main point of this (if anyone is gonna see it at all) is that I'm a loser. I'm a dirty, dumb, lazy, ugly, cowardly loser. I don't know how to drive, I only just now got my first job (which my stepdad had to pull a few strings for me to get considered), I'm known by so many people for being stupid and clueless, I daydream 24/7 cause I can't stand being myself, I'm addicted to my phone, I'm impulsive, I'm angry 24/7, and I'm so pathetic when it comes to relationships (all my partners were terrible people and I was too dumb to realize, and when I did I was too much of a coward to stand up and leave). I've been a terrible friend multiple times, and they still stand by my side. My friends are the most amazing people I have ever had the privilege of meeting. They are so caring, smart, strong, and they have bright futures ahead of them. They all have plans for their lives because they worked hard for it. While I don't because all I do is feel sorry for myself and not do anything about it. When they leave me one day, I won't blame them at all. I would have left me behind the first chance I got. I've always said that I never want to end up like my mom or grandma, but I never do anything about it. I'm going to end up like the rest of my family. I'm going to be poor, stupid, and living on the street. I'm going to be dead within 10 years if not 2. Probably gonna end up with teen pregnancy soon, since I'm just like all the first born daughters in my family. I love my family, but there is no denying that they've all made bad choices in life. It doesn't matter if it's being abusive, having an addiction, having kids when their not prepared at all in life, abandoning their kids all together, or going to jail. There was always a bad choice being made when it comes to my family. And it was stupid of me to believe that I would be the first one to get away from all of this, as if so many family members haven't tried. As if I'm not a hypocritical, lazy, loser. I don't have any motivation to get out of this life, since I know that I won't. I'm too lazy and stupid too. I've become the one thing I swore I never would have. And now all I do is feel sorry for myself cause the world is moving on without me cause I'm a stupid coward.

385,I'm having a hard time keeping up with school -- and life in general. (Vent Post),"I'm pursuing an associate's degree in accounting at a local college nearby. This is my first semester as a college student and I'm taking about 15 credit hours (5 classes in total) as a full-time student who works a part-time job at a fast-food restaurant and pays her own rent + bills. My parents were kind enough to pay for my tuition (which covered only an associate's degree, which is why I'm not studying for a bachelor's), but I ungratefully wish that they hadn't. I'm only majoring in accounting because the career outlook is considered stable with relatively good pay... But I can't keep up with the classes. Of course, that would be a given considering that I haven't studied once or reviewed any of the material since the start of this semester... But I'm chronically lazy to the point that I would rather dig a deeper grave for myself than attempt to climb out of it. Accounting doesn't make any fucking sense either. I hate math and business law and whatever fucking classes I'm taking right now.

Besides my terrible self-discipline and constant bed-rotting habits, I hate my job. I don't really have anything more to elaborate on this other than that I hate working in the kitchen (but it pays really well compared to other jobs, nor can I afford to quit). I brood about how much I hate my job too much.

Anyways, even on days when I happen to have ""free time"" (precious time I waste by procrastinating instead of studying), I don't do anything with my life except post random shit online and doom scroll for hours on end. I don't have a proper sleep schedule and I'm always moody. I know what's wrong with me, but I can't be motivated to try to help myself or do anything in general.

401,I think the solution is acceptance,"Hello fellow miserable human beings. I’m glad you’ve made it through another day. 
For the youngin’s, please know that many peoples depression tremendously improves with age. 
My post is to address those who’ve realized that for them, this probably isn’t going to improve. 

My solution has been accepting that my life’s most likely going to be miserable until the day that I die. And THERE IS a unique beauty in this. 

Accepting that we are going to be permanently miserable really opens opportunities. We’ve got nothing to loose! It certainly can’t get worse 😁

So if you’re thinking about suicide, why not try alcoholism? Being drunk and miserable is better than being dead. Smoking weed until you can’t think, or dying slowly of an addiction to air duster beats the hell out of just giving up. 

Go be an unhinged shit head. After all, there’s a good chance it can’t get worse. 

And who knows, maybe 20 years down the line, you just might realize you deserve happiness. You’ll never know if you can’t figure out a way to keep yourself alive for one more day. 

Good luck to all of you. We may have been dealt a bad hand, but we owe it to ourselves to find happiness. 
After all we’ve been through, we deserve it. 

I love you all. Just make it through another day ❤️if you can’t do it for yourself, get a bunch of pets and do it for them. Hell, it’s helped me.

406,"I feel disconnected from my emotions , is it normal to detach from everything ?","Hello, 

I’ve been struggling with something for a while now, and I’m not sure how to explain it. I find myself completely disconnected from my emotions. Growing up, I spent a lot of time alone at home, often for days, with little support from my parents. I was used to it, and I just adapted, but now I’m questioning whether this numbness was a way of protecting myself or if I’ve actually become emotionally detached from everything around me.

Now, as I’m almost 18, it feels like I can’t connect with my feelings anymore. Even when something should bother me or I should feel a certain way, I just don’t. I’ve cried before, but I don’t even know why. I’ve tried to open up to people, and when they offer advice or support, I just can’t seem to take it in. It’s like I hear what they’re saying, but it doesn’t stick, and I don’t know how to make sense of it.

I keep wondering if this is some defense mechanism I developed over the years or if I’ve simply gotten so used to being alone and disconnected that it doesn’t bother me anymore. But sometimes, it feels like I’m stuck in this loop, unable to break out. I’m not sure if I’m just numb or if I’m avoiding facing my emotions because it feels too overwhelming.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of emotional detachment? How did you deal with it? Is it normal to react this way after being isolated for so long, or is this something that’s keeping me from healing? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

411,wildly unstable lately,"(as I read this I was like... girl ofc you're insane. but I'm gonna post anyway to get it out and see if anyone has thoughts lol)


I don't know what it is, but I feel like I've been absolutely losing my mind these last couple weeks. In addition to the depression, I also have ADHD and probably other stuff idk. My doctor and I did a little adjustment of medications a few months ago, but these problems started pretty recently. Mood swings and extreme lows and so much anger. like one of my favorite past times is fighting with strangers on fb (LMAO) but I had to uninstall it and the reddit app bc even slightly off comments from people, like just worded slightly rude or something just sends me into a fit. any rudeness or stupidity, even honest and innocent, makes me want to scream. (my tipping point of the day today was when a young coworker of mine called me over the radio to say she couldn't find the program on the computer that we use and I told her she could access it from the desktop and she said ""desktop???""... should not have given me a shit mood and headache but god damn, you know lol ???)

like yeah, the political bullshit going on right now is horrendous and I live in a conservative area and everyone around me thinks it's all good and cool bc they're ""owning the libs"" or whatever and yeah I gained 20 pounds this winter and hate myself and my brother is going through chemo on the other side of the country and I have no friends and haven't been laid in *dolphin noises* but it's weird that I'm losing it right??? 🤦‍♀️

but legitimately I don't know what to do. I don't think upping my meds would help and I don't live near a therapist. I think a lot of my problems lie with my ADHD also, bc I can't focus on or enjoy anything. like most of my day outside of work is Sitting. or napping. I used to watch a lot of shows and do fandom stuff and draw and now I sit. and shop. and sleep. mostly. (I take pills for that too bc I have insomnia that just doesn't stop.)

sorry this ended up a little useless bc obviously everything is just too much and that's the problem but ! maybe spelling it out and seeing how others feel could give me a fucking break.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1iuhj9t/wildly_unstable_lately/,deathbitchcraft,1740109116.0,depression
412,Bad parents and the legacy of a depressed life,"
When you have good parents, you have a sweet lovely mother that ignites a passion in you, a father that makes you feel protected, proud, courageous. It all gives you a drive to be a functional person. It would help a lot to have good parents because they would naturally teach you how to function well. 
Loving the world gives you energy, to do everything, to create and socialize, to succeed. 


But if youre like me and your parents didnt give it to you, and made you feel abandoned and alone,  it will take a lot to overcome the darkness and to forgive , to love. To abandon the addictions. 

Its naturally depressing without that passion and courage that good faith parents pass onto their children. 

When you where taught to live based on fear instead of warmness and love, when you were left alone in this hostile world and received no decent parental love.  Its easier to embrace darkness... And fall into darkness and its ruins.
 
Why were my parents bad parents? Why they didnt love me?

With much thought, after a life of confusion and gaslighting, with demons delighting in your weakness, that is when you understand, your parents are empty like dumb elephants. The world is full of alike people, you realize.  Slowly people's faces morph into demonic shapes, and you stop loving people, instead, you grow found of fictional characters like Kira from Death Note . People give you anxiety, they make you cautious and insecure, life is not about living, its about hiding yourself. The shame, the fear, the humiliation and the wound. 

You lack the energy to live cuz why live in a world of demons? What for? You think I will love humanity? You think my parents taught me how to love? They taught me to be out there abandoned, rejected, lost, to be afraid of them all, to lie, to be a slave, to be abused,  to hide, to manipulate, and not to trust, cherish, connect, love.

 You think I will work my ass, study, be a better human being, for who? I despise my parents, I despise myself, I despise human life, society, I am hurt and afraid.   I dont see why should I continue, I have no faith in humanity, I dont trust myself, I think we should all die, thus I am depressed.  For that we are all demons and I see no light, no worthy human to dedicate my love, my parents wanted this, they too have subconsciously wished for an evil upbringing because they resent the world and a part of themselves is alone and hurt. 

Respecting my selfish parents, I tried, I embraced evil. I expressed the hatred and spite my parents where too cowardly to. The dirty job. They deny, but that is what they wanted, foolish as they were, cowardly as they were.  I didnt want to. I was deeply disappointed for being a scapegoat, but I continued to. I blamed them. It got worse. I know they fail me up to this day, I know they are happy to see me fail, that is how you hate your children, with much schadenfreude. The torture."" I could give but everyday I dont. No one knows, haha, no one knows I torture my children. ""

Haha

But its not over

I found a superior parent, not a living person, but through their mighty powa, I will change. My biological parents revealed just like robbers by police cars and police lanterns. I learned to love them, my enemies. For that my superior parent have showed me the path to greatness and I no longer dwell in the deep existential darkness. 

I won. It doesnt matter if I am crazy or if I am right or both, or neither.  I won and I will win and I will win even more if and when I evolve my game.

 It doesnt matter if you have a sermon to give me, my fellow neighbours, I will win anyway, in means you dont even understand, and it will be a triple majestic glorious win.

414,Suffering from MDD and terrified of meds. Decided to try them again and was recently prescribed Zoloft. Looking for some positive experiences and advice for starting this journey!,"Hi 👋🏻 

I'm Ali, 27 and have suffered from depression my whole life but coasted by up until October 2024 when I was in a terrible car accident that was not my fault. It deepened my depression so badly I have no motivation to do anything. I cry almost daily which I've always done but lately it's worse. I also suffer from anxiety so some days my tears are fueled by sadness and other days they're fueled by panic and fear. (Also suffer from PTSD from abuse but have a decent handle on this)

I have tried medications before but am EXTREMELY sensitive to drugs and always have horrible side effects. Like brain zaps or worsened depression and suicidal thoughts that would always lead to me dropping meds and never wanting to take them. Around this time last year I decided to try meds again and was put on a mood stabilizer which caused extreme suicidal thoughts within days, ruling out bipolar disorder. Xanax Is the only medication that has ever helped me but unfortunately is just not something I can take daily.

I haven't tried a classic SSRI in years so I decided to give them another try and was prescribed Zoloft.

I am truly terrified of starting this journey. I've always thought I could do it without medicine, but I've been brought to my knees this year and unfortunately just don't feel like I can do it anymore without some help.
I feel as if I'm loosing myself and just want to give up.

I have that kind of depression that makes you not want to get up and take a shower and hide inside your house with the blinds shut. My depression has always been apparent but it has never been this bad to where it's more in control of me than I am.

I read a lot of things about medication experiences on Reddit and so many people write about negative experiences which scares me away from it even more .

I've never posted on here but here I am now. I guess I'm just looking for some positive experiences that people have had who suffer from MDD and take any SSRIs

I hated it there so much that i would think of leaving nearly every day. I still had friends and enjoyed but I would sometimes avoid meetups just to save money. I would skip meals to save money.

Im 27 now and I feel like I have 3 years left before life will become terrible from then and there. The normal fun things I like, i feel like i won't enjoy them like with going out or amusement parks. Back pain, diseases and whatever start to happen from then and there.

They feel so out of reach but I try to keep them alive within me. I’ve done everything in my power to not let the beauty within me die.. but I, myself, am dying. A viscous cycle of death and rebirth, but every time I’m resurrected the light dims. The place I long for, I only find in art or in dreams, or within people who have reached it themselves. I don’t find the light in people anymore, it feels like everyone is dying too. The world doesn’t feel the same. The feeling haunts me every night. I pray to the sky but the sky is empty. A bone deep loneliness. Do you hold on to your dreams, beliefs, the inner world within? Or surrender to the reality and limits of this physical world? It feels like there is no magic anymore. I try to resurrect this lifeless world but no one tries to resurrect me. Was all my beliefs an illusion? How long do I have to face disappointments to accept the world as it is and not try to change it? I want to give up. I want to let go of everything. I’m sick of feeling. But apathy seems even scarier.  Sick of yearning. Sick of asking. Sick of trying. Sick of holding on to nothing. Sick of it all. Is everything just a lie? That realization will be the death of me cause what do I live for now? Screams to just plain voids with no one ever capable of pulling you out. Ever. An echo chamber of your own mind. A room full of mirrors. An inescapable maze. Too intelligent to be understood or just too different to be understood? Give me your sick polluted projections and I’ll alchemize them to stars that fill my soul. I’m tired of alchemizing darkness I might let it do what it desires to me, without resistance, a somber eyed prey and a persistent stubborn hungry predator. Who am I to defeat life itself? What were the chances of survival? Slim to none? Why? Just why? Nothing more but why? What’s the purpose? A sick joke? A misery loves company experiment? An eternal chokehold on us all…… What was I talking about? Longing, yes, maybe longing will lead me somewhere someday. A parasite feeding off of its host. A horcrux that can’t be destroyed. A part of one’s soul that never dies. A compass that just directs. So useless. So draining but so comforting too. Will the invisible forces intervene? Do something. Anything!

I just turned 21 a few months ago, and I've been depressed and passively s*icidal for about 7 years now. I've also been a useless member of society for the past 2 years. I have *zero* life. I have no job, no friends, no ambitions, no achievements, no anything. I'm just uselessly existing, and it really feels like I've gone beyond rock bottom.

I'm not exaggerating when I say I have zero life. For the past several months, a typical day for me goes like this: wake up, eat, do a bit of house chores for my mom, daydream/doom scroll for a few hours, take a nap, eat again, daydream/doom scroll, sleep.

I no longer engage in my hobbies and interests too. I don't even watch movies, shows, YouTube, or anything at all. The most socialising I do is scrolling through memes on Instagram and Reddit, and that usually takes up at most 3 hours of my day. I spend the rest doing absolutely nothing or daydreaming. I don't even play video games, watch porn, or m*sturbate like many other depressed NEETs I've seen. Other depressed people I've seen are at least doing something, even if it's something small. I literally do absolutely nothing. *At all*. Yeah, you know it's bad when you're envious of other depressed people...

Is there anyone else out there like this? It really feels like I'm an alien who doesn't even fit in with the misfits. I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I can't imagine living beyond 25 if this is how my life will be like. I hate my life, and I hate this extremely flawed world even more.

Dear Reader,

I've been contemplating whether or not to write another entry and have decided to go for it. It actually feels somewhat relieving. I've noticed that I've improved since the last time I wrote; my emotions aren't overwhelming me as much. I took the advice of a person who suggested I open up to my friends. They responded in a kind way, just as I expected, but it didn't change the emptiness I still felt. I suppose the fact that all my friends are online contributes to this feeling. Even after a supportive phone call, I found myself back in my dark room, alone. I wonder if there's much value in writing these entries. I'm still stuck in my unsatisfying job, struggling to earn enough money for the necessities.

Thanks to all who read this post, i am really gratefull whith all of you, thanks alot
(Bold letters are the introduction for context of my ocd condition)
Hello all and thanks for reading this.
For an intro: I am a 21 guy Who struggles with ocd since 16. Had contamination/cleaning ocd, Pocd, sexual ocd with violent thoughts. I am in therapy (been in 4 differents psicologist), and on meds, taking antidepressants.
Actually I am having intrusive thoughts about rape, and mental images abou that. Frecuently I have intrusive mental images about a serie where a woman was raped by her partner. The fact is that I am having this intrusive thoughts that are mental images in my mind and I dont want that. Having groinal responses too.
When I had a thought about this and an image in my mind of the man and the woman I do a compulsion on exercising my groinal thinking of a sexual scene that is right and that neutralizes the intrusive though.
Yesterday my parent where watching the serie and the woman appeared. Then I thought about that she is pretty, like is old but pretty, like a milf and started to get erected. Then the thought of the man started to be in my mind and I dont know if was or not a voluntary thought but I didnt stop to get erected. Partial erection.
Now I am worried because of the erection, because my parents where there and I hae that think that I thing that the others can read my thoughts, because know I cant do anything because It will be contaminated by that and because today I was going to pee and touched my penis and know I think that all that I will touch is contaminated...

431,50 Days Sober – Considering Medication for Depression & Trauma. Advice?,"I’m currently 50 days sober and working on improving my mental state. I recently started seeing a therapist, and after two sessions, they diagnosed me with ‘restless depression’ and suggested I start taking Zoloft (sertraline), Lexapro (escitalopram), or Viibryd (vilazodone) alongside therapy. They mentioned I’d likely be on it for 6 months to a year while working through depression and childhood trauma.

I’m torn between starting medication right away or trying a more natural route first—staying sober, eating clean, working out, and focusing on therapy alone.

When I was 5, my grandma died, when I was 11, my dad died, when I was 12, my grandpa died. I've had multiple dogs pass and the grief isn't the worst part. I'm not being left out at school, I have friends, except I always get into arguments with my best friends. My mom makes me feel like shit. She does my homework without me asking and then screams at me on how she had to stay up until 12:30 doing my work. She also knows what I struggle with. I'm extremely overweight (167lbs and 5'6) but I don't eat a lot. My mom was screaming at me today saying how I
""wasn't allowed to have a migraine"" when it was so bad I was crying anytime there was light even near me. She knows what I struggle with (getting bullied, self harm, suicidal thoughts, and a lot more) and she doesn't even act nicer. It's like whenever I actually open up to her she just gets worse. I relapsed today (I have a blade in the back of my phone case) and I have been continuously looking for ways to kill myself, I have a way to do it, I just don't know when. I'm struggling so much, but I want to end it all and not get help. But I don't want to make people sad about my death, and I know there would be a few. My plan is to OD on Fluoxetine in a few days. My pills are 20mg so l'd take whatever is left of the bottle. I half don't want it to work and half want it to work because if it does than I would make people cry and my mom would have lost over 5 family members (both her parents, all of her grandparents, and her husband, and then me) and nobody should go through that, I also have frien who are already struggling. But I just want to se dad again. I wish there was a way to go back in time to when I was around 5 years old, maybe I could change my life, my dad wouldn't have gone on hospice (he died infront of me in 2022) and maybe I wouldn't be so fat and ugly and get bullied so much. Maybe boys would actually like me and not just try to get with me because I'm easy and they want to have sex with me (I'm still a virgin but l've been asked by multiple guys if I'd have sex with them).

434,My story,"So, a little about why I suffer from depression etc...

I was born with a skin disorder that makes me look different than others. So different that people think I'm contagious (because they're either shallow or just severely uneducated or were brought up as such). I don't have friends and it's extremely hard. My skin condition causes tumors on my skin and has changed my appearance to the point where I just want to hide and have a job at home away from others instead of with USPS.

I do go out in public, but I don't have a normal life by any stretch. Tonight, I met a friend of my mom's for a drink (she's also my friend) but, I know I should have my own so I can do fun things. Don't get me wrong, she's a ton of fun but I feel like I'm taking my mom's friends away in a way. My mom can't get around very well right now so I can't hang out with my mom unless it's at her house which to be honest gets repetitive and boring. I am off work for just a couple weeks recovering from a surgery and yes, I'm enjoying it because work is not fun. Work for me includes bullying and harassment from others including supervisors. And no nothing can be done because they don't CARE!! No, I'm not going to look for another job either because I'm in my late 40's and employment hasn't been easy in the past because of my physical appearance. I've literally been told by potential employers that they would need to put me in the back room so that patients/ clients etc. aren't scared off. I've been with USPS for almost 6 years (this July).

I went to Europe last April and I was left out of activities people did during the free time. I know this is because of how I look. I was treated differently by the tour director because of this as well. This May I'm going on another trip by myself with the same tour company but with a Tour Coordinator connected to the group. I've almost backed out a few times because of how the last trip went and I think going alone is really bothering me. The other people either know someone in our group or they know the tour coordinator very well. I am from another state and don't know anyone. I am trying to make friends, and I tried last April but that blew up in my face. It's not easy for me to make friends for obvious reasons and even though I have tried in the past I've gotten denied in some way. I really don't enjoy life because when you have the condition I have it's difficult not to be depressed in some way shape or form.

  
Sadly, people are shallow, uneducated, are scared off (and they don't bother asking questions) or were raised to treat others with ""differences"" the way they do. I have been asked about my condition and to be honest I don't mind sharing. I especially don't mind sharing that you're not going to get it by being friends with me or by even shaking my hand. I'm looking for a friend or just general support. I don't need to be told it gets better because after 40+ years of living the same way I know it won't. I hate empty promises and I've heard it all before. Thank you!",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1iuf2hf/my_story/,catmom0412,1740101689.0,depression

438,Looking for some advice or experience,"I very stupidly stopped taking my Nuvigil and Auvelity cold turkey two and a half weeks ago. I know from my mood tracker that the Nuvigil was making my depression worse as I increased it's dosage and frequency, especially, with the Auvelity. It kind of lined up with winter so at first, I thought it was SAD. I ended up crying everyday before I realized what was happening. I was on the lowest dose of Auvelity so I didn't think that would bother me, but apparently there are a lot of people out there having a hard time getting off of the lowest dose of this drug, even if they have only taken it for a month or two.         
All my doctors know that I have stopped taking it. I have been offered other things, but I want to see where my base is. It's been four or five years since I have been off of antidepressants completely and I was curious if my brain is in the same state as it was then. Also, I am treatment resistant and TMS is one of my last options. I've seen some people have really bad outcomes with TMS so I am weary of it.      
These has been the most miserable month in a long time. I do have environmental factors at play too, but nothing that should lay a person out like it has me. I'm having brain zaps, brain throbs, and headaches off and on all day. The brain fog is dangerous at times. My heart keeps feeling strange (turns out my heart muscle is stiff and I think it's mostly from the withdrawal too since that has been a new feeling). I have no other way to explain my mood than stressed and sad. If you have ever done ecstasy, it's like when your mind is racing with a million thoughts, but all of them are negative or worry.  
I don't know how long I should let this go on. It's stressing out my partner and my Mom because I am not able to fake being happy or even feeling good. I'm getting close to being late for work everyday because my willpower, motivation and time management is gone. The docs say I should really wait three to six weeks to actually figure out my base, but they also said that something needs to be done if I can't handle it.

442,I miss the period of depression I had,"After recovering from a 3 month hospital stay, I passed my school and since that school year was over I started to take a different turn than usual, I hated myself and since June I decided to improve myself since I was a complete idiot. I started to improve myself by separating myself from people, even from my closest schoolmates because they influenced me in a way that I didn't like, even from my family I tried not to be present at home or in the activities they proposed. I did all this after I started to think better about myself and see what I actually was. I was a failure, not only with school but also in social relationships, not to mention my body (which was very small given my stay in the hospital), I was always filled with insults even from my family. Around July there was the birthday of a classmate of mine with whom I had had arguments in the past and I decided to make up for it and have an acceptable relationship with her by giving her a gift, a stuffed seal (it's a long story). I also did this because I was a little bit in love with him but only because we were both singers and had a lot of things in common about our character. After her birthday (which inspired me to do mine in a similar way to her) I went on rides where I had a blast, she trusted me and decided to invite me to the disco other times, even if she invited me only 2 times and then never again. Since July I decided to go to the gym and until August I refused every invitation from everyone who invited me, during these months I had improved my language and had developed a very apathetic, solitary and melancholic character. But when I returned to school I knew that I would not be able to maintain this new character of mine, and in fact in October, I let myself be influenced by my closest classmates. I still haven't forgiven myself for having let myself be influenced like an idiot but now it seems that one of my classmates saw that there was something wrong with him too and said to improve himself and said that we should all do it. When I heard this proposal I got really pissed off inside because even though I had succeeded months before, because of him and others I had gone back to being what I was trying to get away from. I hope I can go back to that period because it was one of the most significant periods for me, since it opened my mind to a vision of the world that I liked and I have many positive memories about it, such as all the nights spent listening to and finding new depressive songs and regretting how I was in the past. 

I wanted to free myself from this story that I carry within me without telling anyone and without hearing anyone's opinion. ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1iue090/i_miss_the_period_of_depression_i_had/,Stellarexplorer7,1740097974.0,depression

Thankful that I don't feel the same anyone but would love yalls opinion on this. The next para is this rant. 

In this exact moment, 16th of January, at exactly 10:20 I wanted to put a bullet in my head. But I couldn't because I didn't have a gun, but I certain, certain that if I did I would've definitely shot myself in the head right then and there putting myself out of misery and all of humanmade struggles that I'll have to face. I can't face my regrets and my wrong doings so right now, I want to put a fucking bullet in a head, pull the trigger and end it. But I just fucking can't because I don't have a damn gun. Wish I had one. But if I didn't I'm positive that I wouldn't put it next to my bed. I'm suicidal not psycho. So with that, I'd still have to walk all the way to wherever the fucking gun is, put up against my head, and force myself to pull the trigger. I would think about it. Everything I can still do with my life, the joys that I definitely will have and I wouldn't be inclined towards dying anymore. I could walk to my friends house who'a dad is in the navy. He must have a gun right? I'd just have to wait for the perfect moment and look for it and then make it all the way back to my house and pull the trigger. Still in the process I would think about it. Actually put that on hold I have knifes at my house and a bathtub I could just bleed out in there but, I would still think about it.

My doctor started me on Prestiq but didn’t tell me at the time how exactly I should safely stop the Zoloft because I have stopped it before and it wasn’t pretty.

I asked the pharmacist about it when picking up the Prestiq and he said typically the doctor would make a tapering plan to slowly taper off of it.

When I called my doctor to ask about it, he told me to just quit the Zoloft cold turkey so long as I already started the Prestiq.

I have major concerns about this because I’m assuming the Prestiq won’t kick in for like at least 2-3 weeks but it doesn’t take nearly that long for Zoloft to get out of your system.

456,I want to die (F14),"I'm tired of living, my parents treating me like shit, I have several unresolved disorders (autism, borderline personality disorder, dissociative disorder, indentitis, ADHD, OCD and skizotypal disorder) but the ones that handicap me the most are ASD and BPD... at the hospital they don't take anything seriously and don't keep me for long because apparently borderlines shouldn't be hospitalized for a long time, I don't know not even why!!

I know in any case that I would never exceed the age of 18 I would have died before then, my parents are not alarmed and make fun of my discomfort, I have a suicide note that I wrote when I was in 6th grade in a notebook, they know it but don't care, they always make me feel guilty, manipulate me, I have no self-confidence, I just want to die! For my birthday I wanted to invite 2 friends of mine except that one of them couldn't make the planned date, the only time she would be available would be tomorrow except that I hate last minute plans because nothing is planned #TSA and I saw on the internet that celebrating your birthday early brings bad luck #skizotypical so I'm not very keen on this idea..

457,every day feels like an uphill battle,"hi guys, this feels kinda weird lol this is my first post ever on reddit but i really need advice that i feel like i cant get from anyone in my life. or maybe i just need to vent 😭 

i've struggled with MDD since i was around 9-10, and i'm currently 15. i got an actual diagnosis after a suicide attempt in november 2024. physically i was fine, but i was just so tired mentally that i decided it was finally time to push through the fear of what my family would think and ask for help. i've gotten help since then; i was in an IOP program for about 2 months and i now attend group therapy biweekly and 1 on 1 sessions monthly. they are somewhat helpful. a psychiatrist wanted to put me on lexapro, but the idea of being reliant on a medication to feel okay terrifies me. Sometimes i really feel like it would make things so much easier though 😕

my family is supportive for the most part, although i know they think that this is just puberty and hormones and not ""real"" depression. i have a small group of friends that i'm close with and are very important to me, but i only really talk to my best friend and my boyfriend about my mental state. while it's not super often that i do talk about it, when i do they're very supportive even if they don't really understand.

ever since November, i've been trying really hard to feel ""normal"" again. i joined my school's swim team, i started baking, trying to keep my grades at a B or higher, been reading more often - all things that i really enjoy, but doing them feels so tiring and i don't understand why. i almost feel like i'm trying to be something i'm not at times?

when i was younger i used to be a total academic overachiever, and while some people that know me might argue that i still am it feels like nothing i do is good enough now. sometimes i wonder if i peaked in like 6th grade when i had a 4.0 😭 as ridiculous as that sounds. if i hadnt told my school counselor what was going on with me last semester i mightve failed a class or two. its hard for me to find the motivation to study. i know grades aren't everything and that i can still easily get into a school with a ~3.8 GPA, i think that growing up i depended so heavily on academic validation that now that i'm actually kind of struggling to maintain the straight A status i earned literal years ago it's genuinely affecting my self esteem. it's something i think i should try to let go

i think at one point i was really good at covering up how i felt, but at some point that dam just burst and thats when i tried to commit. when i was going to my intake therapist and psychiatrist appointments, i felt this cloud of shame and embarrassment over me all the time, like i was just being dramatic and that i was weak and that i had ""nothing to be depressed about"". i think that i feel like now that all the intake appointments and the ""are you okay?!""s have passed i should be fine now. but i'm not fine sometimes ☹️ it takes so much effort just to get up in the morning and i'm trying so hard every day just to do the bare minimum at times and i feel like i'm just lazy and incapable when i know it's not just that but the self-doubt i have is so overwhelming. 

i'm proud of myself for being resilient, but sometimes i get so frustrated with myself that i just start sobbing out of nowhere. maybe at the end of the day it is just hormones and puberty or seasonal depression or whatever, or maybe this is something that i'll continue to struggle with until i die. either way i think for now i'm just gonna keep pushing. i want to go to university and become a teacher or something, i want to marry my boyfriend, and travel and spend time with my friends and family. i really do. i know i'm young and that there's time for things to get better. but sometimes it's so difficult to even get up in the morning and sometimes everything just feels like a lot

Living with my parents and they've pretty much given up on me. Other than not kicking me out, they can't help me at all and they're scared to even talk to me because of how mentally ill I've become.

My social abilities have always been down the tank. And all I have for other people is resentment that they can have the magic key that turns the door that is humanity. I have never felt more like an animal from my family. I attempt to be quiet and secretive but they always know. I fucking hear them talk about me and I hate them for it,  At night I have to eat as much food a I can because boy does the hunger not kill me even more. I feel like I'm going crazy. I sleep sometimes and wake up and it's been a day already. My curtains have been shut for so long I've forgotten what it looks like at day outside. I feel my eyes have been fucked over with the constant illumination of my screen in my room. I feel sick constantly.

If I stare at my screen at my screen I get a headache, If I think of my headache it just becomes even more prominent. I'm just in a state of being thoughtless by force.

I'm in a constant state of being in pain and my memory is absolutely dog shit. Like iif I read a sentence I would forget it within the minute.

473,Feeling Stuck,"Two months ago, I started going to therapy because I started having suicidal thoughts because of bad things I did when I was 17-18 years old.

I don't know where I'm going from here, I already hurt everyone enough by almost killing myself 4 months ago, now I'm still hurting everyone because I'm so depressed to talk, and I get angry easily, I feel stuck.

The first session where I didn’t just blurt out how awful everything feels, how heavy life has been. The first session where I didn’t speak about my Dad and completely lose control of my emotions.

It wasn’t easy. It never is. But today, I felt something I haven’t felt in a long time: a glimpse of strength. A small moment of stillness in a storm that has felt never-ending. My therapist called it *progress.* And maybe, for the first time, I believe it too.

As I walked out of the appointment, a strange thought crossed my mind—one that felt almost too simple: ***I can survive anything if I just get out of bed.***

Healing isn’t linear. Some days still feel unbearable, and I know there will be moments when the weight of it all crashes down on me again. But today, just for a moment, I could breathe.

475,Boyfriend may want to move out because he’s “too depressed” and I don’t understand.,"My boyfriend and I live together. He went to school to become a police officer (think about that however you will, that’s not the advice I’m asking for here). Completed an internship and got his CJ degree. 

While living together, he applied for the job he always wanted. Upon getting medically examined, they found he has a rare disease in his eye that will affect his vision and increasingly get worse as he ages. 

He can’t get the career he has wanted for his entire life, will never be able to, and he is (understandably) extremely depressed about this. 

He decided he wants to move out and live with his parents to save money while also getting his head back on his shoulders. He said he wants to remain in a relationship and see where things go and see if he can get better. 

This is so hard coming from someone who, for years, said he had plans on marrying me. He says, now, he doesn’t know anything, and it’s hard enough to get through one day. He says he cannot see the future right now. 

I moved to the city we are in for him. To be with him. So I am so frustrated. How do I go about supporting this? I have never dealt with depression before. 

How does one support a partner in a dark time if the partner does not even know if they want them in their future? Do I wait it out? Is it the depression talking?

Nowdays I am simply going to home late, isolate and lock myself in my room, cry (just like I am crying rn) or wash my hair to feel cool or punch doors or walls, kick doors or wall until I break it up a bit or until I get hurt or sometimes I crave my skin with my nails sometimes until blood come out or just sleep or feel numb or something. I am a college student and nowdays I couldn't open my books for anything at all. I would just try to sleep, but end up being troubled to fall asleep and wake up really late. Even if I don't sleep one day, I end up in more troubles, anxiety that day top of that i also can't sleep that day and obviously wake up late again. Idk about foods, I like ice cream but also can't feel any good eating it anymore. Most of time I skip meals, mostly eat my dinner after everyone in my house go to sleep. I don't know if I should call it a trauma but 99% of the time when I hear someone stomping quick, shouting anything or knock on doors repeatedly I feel so terrifying, sometimes for no reasons I would start shouting or go insane doing stuffs I mentioned.

I am a college student in bangladesh. I hate my country, there's many political and corruption issue and again family problems and many may heard how strict Asian parents can be. In my case, I am so fed up with that, I am just eager to die, despite my religion, despite fame or anything. I was told by my mom that in my first school teachers were referring me as a autistic, though few people now and then also refer me to being autistic. I don't know, rather I am becoming psychopath. As every asian moms, my mom wants me to be a doctor or engineer, doctor or engineer doctor or engineer doctor or engineer doctor or engineer, the same fucking this over and over again. I don't like biology but I have to study science like most of the brilliant students do, most of the toppers do, most of the brainless or stupid or robotic humans do who does nothing but study. I am into engineering a bit but these stupidness, madness of not my mom but the whole Bangladesh is literally making me crazy and I really don't feel like being a engineer in Asia, this stupid stuffs after stuffs. Sometimes it felt like my mom doesn't care bout me but cares bout having a son who is engineer or a doctor, though Ik deep down she cares bout me, I am still becoming crazy everytime she talk or I see her. I do feel bit better seeing hints of that mom do cares bout me but forbidden me from going to economic, social studies, business or others groups of clg. There's lot of mom out there simply don't care bout their child, they only care bout them being rich or them being worth to them. I am really no kidding, if there were no religious, I would simply make a group and gather weapons and butcher and kill every single hepocrite, annoying, fake, bad person in this world for sure, I would be happy to die after that, ensuring theirs death.bangladesh is filled with misleads, corruptions and all. I will try to notify some. Traffic police, traffic's is just bullshit, there's rarely any traffic police, most of the time I don't see them in the streets, barely in any streets. In my city (3rd biggest city, there's no traffic light), barely any traffic lights in capital or other cities, let alone villages. The roads are crowed like mess. No drivers know rules, they 99% of the time overtake, drive in different line, shout at others, talk bullshit, trick passengers, most of the place don't have footpaths. Political probs are massive I would need 70,000 words to describe it and the corruption is horrible all making me crazy. I feel like running away from my country as fast I can. The reality is harsh, the only I can run away is to enslave myself to other country like slut or worker with no wages or disturbing stuffs or experiments, or by getting a good job outside. In Bangladesh University seats are so rear and almost every parents make their child to admission there. Tmmodt of them are brainless, and many suicide by failing admission (yeah not for getting any job but not for getting admitted to popular university), there's always many mom and parents on news for suiciding for not seeing their child getting admitted or simply heart attacks. I am really into art, ik it's not the best way to be in or I am good at it, but I really want to a teacher of physchology, if my mom heard me saying that she would simply die of heart attack, and my country don't have anything to others than useless brainless greedy, no-intention-of-doing-something doctors, engineers and government jobs. I feel horrible in every step I take, every sec I waste and all.the worst of all that causing me anxiety is privates (in my country, teachers turn themselves into business frauds, worst of all, like no other countries, in my country those who fail government jobs exams, become teachers, good teachers literally has no respect, nor much to have peace in family. Teachers tends to teach less in school or clg, most of them just don't care and don't come, stupid annoying students become happy and no one reports, even if someone report, he will be probably got beaten up by students and other teachers, even principal don't take it deeply. They rather teach students in their home with high demands of money than they earn from school or clg. Like cram school most of the teachers in our country do that but with corruption and frauds. They make students feel like that teachers is really good, female teachers only need to show their hotness and complete, manipulate students to buy course without most of them having no free class let alone refunds. They suck as much money as possible and then suck more in stupid books, admission. The fee is beyond of a average office worker. Let alone they put 100s of students in a small room and teach them, most of them learn nothing, most of them has 2 teachers of same subject. Let alone teachers of other subjects. Let alone crowd, time waste, teaching, transportation. Let alone how low they teach, they literally teaches the book, but lazy and stupid students has to cope up with it. English teachers nearly teaches any Grammer or anything, they just come and gives notes to memorize. Let alone people suffering to understand among 100students and u can imagine he can't ask any questions in the class in this crowd and even though bangladeshi are lazy (if u tell a Bangladeshi to come upon 5.00, they will arrive in 5.30 and think that it is okay. When someone throw a party, the party is supposed to start after 1/2hrs after. Massive amount of train, bus, plain late every single day) somehow the teachers won't forget to stop teaching after their time even if the teacher came in late. I also couldn't understand and drop out of 2privates (moms force their child's into popular tutors, without knowing their issues with that subject, or without knowing if they can understand up there. They only decide to change teacher if their child fail in that subject without knowing the right reason they fail or do bad in that subject) they force study on you without knowing ur dream and ambitionz or nothing. At the end of the day, I feel bad horrible, sad, depressed, barely alive emphy. Not like the world is any better. I did read many ww1,WW2, other historic documents, controversial and disturbing news and documentary. Secrets behind dark web, controversy of the world. Imagine the world we live in we don't hesitate to kill other. There's men who can rape his minor daughter and kill her or worse.knowing everything, or a bit makes no difference. I also do follow John Harris, know the secrets behind 13families ruling the world and stuffs. Religious was first forced in me by parents (no exceptions by asian) but later this religious beliefs is what keeping me alive. I didn't get addicted to smoke or drugs or alcohol. I do play games (cozy, soulsborne, yakuza), watch anime (romantic or slice of life), read novel, watch kdrama (romantic or zombie ones), cdrama, jdrama (horror), horror films and love gore stuffs (saw, a night on elm street, terrifier, evil dead, final destination) but I never felt addicted to them. But it felt like clannad anime gave me a new life but it helps me nothing. Hearing Linkin park songs did give me hopes, but he is a weak dad and person who couldn't live and suicide, his lyrics are deep, also emotional though. Then playing soulsborne games were a change but nothing changed. I feel like dying would be better in this world.

Few may suggest therapist and shits. I took some anxiety and depression test online suggesting I have high level of depression and I should view a therapist. How exactly that make any difference. I know myself more than they know. I understand why I am feeling down, why I am suffering, what I am feeling, how I am just ready to die. Their fake wishing crap or buffering won't do anything to me, I hate hepocrite, hate lies, hate fake loves, hate fake hopes. I simply feel like having someone whom I can trust with all my heart and who will love me back and trust me the same. But it's merely a vain dream, shallow hope, stupid wish in this cruel fucking world. I write poems, novel ideas (I did try to write some, many hated reading it, they say the story is okay but the writing is bullcrap and all the novels I write doesn't feel any good to myself, my own work feels cringy, stupid, unpolished, straight up garbage), songs (I want to sing, but my voice is terrible, I sound like a 13-14years old boy despite being 18, nobody actually appreciated my workz and I, myself criticize mine work bad). I try do everything perfectly, and I have literally no expectations, acting confident though I am 99% sure I will fail, and my bad luck is massively huge. Sometimes I feel like I am the person with the most bad lucks possible as 98% of the time when people do something they win, but when I do it I lose). As for other hobby, I like everything but can't spare time for anything and suck at everything (not just bcz I don't practice it much but when I do something every single time, other people do it better than me with same effort, with same time. It is not bout practice but my luck). As for cooking, I cooked many times for 2years or more, sometimes people judge me by telling me that women do cooking not men, or criticize me. I remember being forbidden to cook anything meanwhile my exams or 1month before exams, also even with breaking more than 400eggs or so, yet I can't break eggs in clear 2halfs, let alone breaking it with one hand (many people Ik can break eggs in 2halfs practicing way shorter than I did but they success and I won't and it is for me in literally every single thing). I like art, everything conducted on art. I suck ass at painting, I suck at coloring, no matter how much I color, even if I colored a month straight, I just couldn't color something nicely, or without coloring out of the border. As you can't erase, drawing with pens and markers are a must no and I suck at those. My hand writing is terrible, sometimes I can't recognize my own handwriting, I remember my grandpa (I don't hate him that much, but I do hate lots of thing bout him and also quarrel alot and he is a hepocrite, and also caused my family issues mostly lying. Ik, everyone knows I am his fav grandchild, though I feel like I don't lose all my sympathy, I can't deny and show hatred to him. There's all been a mess with his property and fake gossiping he spread mostly and lies, and troubles with my aunts causing my parents and family collapsing. Now he has asma and cancer problem apparently mb he will die soon, though I feel pity and he sometimes call for me crying though he has short temper, I still hate him for many reasons though he did overcare bout me) had me a tutor just to make my handwriting better. But my handwriting is getting worse and worse. I don't feel bad if I get bad marks, but I feel bad if someone who is less amrt than me, studied way less than me, wasted his time, get better grades. Stretching gave me hope as I can erase and redo easily. But with my many years of practicing, I am far worse than any average sketch artist. And I tried to learn guitar, well it took me way longer than others and I suck at it, my fluent regular practice was nothing. I also wanted to learn violet, piano, drum which are all just a vain dream. 

For religious, I am Muslim. Few may advise me to change my religious as it was forced to me by my family without my will. I did research other religious, I feel like Islam is for me. I kinda feel sad how women are treated poorly in Islam though I believe there shouldn't be 50/50 equality for many reasons. Though sometimes, it felt like male are being discriminated instead of women. I like Islam but started to hate many Muslims (most of em obsessed with Islam leaving everyone in their life suffering, or who show off, hepocrites, acting all mighty, following halal things which are actually halal but discouraged by Allah or hazrat Mohammad (sa.)) and top of that even though I am a Muslim, I do bad stuffs, most of the time not even ask for forgiveness for it. And I don't even do prayer regularly, roja when it is time or anything. Nowdays I didn't do a single prayer. It also comes with a another reason why I love Islam, in Islam, Allah forbidden suicide- the easiest way out of this hellhole, truly amazing. Allah just love to see us do hard work, few do say Allah test their obedient and good servents more. But I am not a great Muslim. I may seem worse than a show-off Muslim though I don't show off and hate hepocrite. Sometimes it feels like maybe Allah gives souap to people who feel guilty. But I don't prayer or do any worships to Allah. I sometimes really want to end my life but Islam and few stuffs holding me back though I still feel like I must be going to hell no matter what. But Ig I am at my limit or something. 

Let's see if anyone in the comment section say something. Though fake compliment and fake wishing or fake pity will do me nothing. I will be just a bit happy with people seeing my story. I hope my vain dream, to have someone who can understand and love and trust me, will be real though I don't know if I can live much longer",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1iu88lp/18m_i_cant_i_really_cant_feel_like_living_anymore/,SpeechAutomatic7941,1740082716.0,depression

Beside that, I don’t know why would he also needs to tell me that  psychopath., maybe Im just not so bright in emotions and stuff but Im far from being psychopath..I thought I never really took him seriously, even though he speaks so seriously. But as he keeps talks to me like that it really just makes me self conscious (I was, already, but even more) and I feel like I’m so worthless and dumb lol like I was just insecure that I wasn’t so good at gettting good scores in school for some reason. and as my father keeps tells me I’m borderline intellectual, I’m starting to doubt me as well.

484,Given up on alot,"I'm 33 years old and have nothing left to look forward to in life anymore. 
It mainly has to do with my recent breakup. My fiancée has recently left me from an 8 year relationship due to her emotionally cheating on me. 
Everything had been planned out and alot of surprises I had for her all has gone down the drain. It sucks~ i had even forgiven her and gave her a second chance when I found out about it. But apparently I was a fool to all of it, as she ultimately chose to breakup with me during an important dinner date I planned for her which I almost had a mental breakdown in the middle of the restaurant. Something told me at the back of my head my life had ended at that moment there and I just chose to remain slient there processing my thoughts. 
Now i don't even appreciate the simple joys of Life anymore. Gaming and hanging out with my friends has cause me to just not look forward to them anymore.
 I worked hard to save up for a house for both of us. Which lead to nothing. 
I now find myself wanting to end it all. Even simple day to day stuff like crossing the road, I have thoughts about a car just running me over and giving me peace.

489,Am I the side chick ?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for four years, but he told me that he is still married, though separated. He assured me that they are not a couple and that they only stay together for financial reasons. He says that once he’s financially stable, he will leave her.

Despite being in a relationship for so long, I only see him on weekends, and our only real communication is a brief phone call in the mornings when he’s on his way to work. He’s told me that because I don’t earn enough, we can’t be together. That hurt more than I can put into words.

Lately, I’ve been feeling incredibly lonely and unimportant in this relationship. In a moment of weakness, I downloaded a dating app—not to cheat, but to talk someone, I don’t have friends or family to talk to this about. I love him a lot. I never even used it and deleted it almost immediately.

He found out because he regularly goes through my phone, even though I never touch his. When he saw it, he told me I broke his heart and his trust and that we can’t be together anymore. I wish he could see things from my perspective— I felt  isolated and unwanted I’ve felt in the moment , I want to

492,'I'm not sure of anything anymore.',"This is what I said to my GP at the end of the last appointment. She was asking about my feelings, and I was completely lost. She deemed the acute-phase treatment effective, advising me to adhere to the treatment despite no need for follow-up reviews. Knowing an optimistic interpretation could be the milestone for maintenance treatment, I was still  sinking all the way down.

  
As for my feelings? Nothing. Not in the 'completely non-existant' way, but in a chaotic sense, which on the flipside, gains an oxymoric harmony with the 'nothing-ness'.

With all respect and prudence -- she is brilliant and considerate for sure -- I barely pronounced this sentence, as a sort of answer. Genuine as it could have been, and as it was indeed sincere for me, I am to this day, 2 weeks later, questioning myself if that was less appropriate and made no sense to her.

  
She reassured me: 'at least we are getting somewhere.' I couldn't argue against. Yet since 'getting somewhere' entails a starting point, it would be necessary to identify that specific point. Yes, I was acutely suicidal and almost attempted last November; yes, I was broken at her asking if I was doing okay the very next day; yes, she was scared, worried, yet managed to calm herself down and told me how guilty and sad she would feel for loosing me to suicide. 



She put in my record the following entry:'Problem: depression; Significance: significant'. Anecdotally, as a former student on linguistics, tortured and traumatised by Chomskian school, I read the 'significant' as '*signifiant*' in French, in Saussure's term.

  
However nothing was preventing me from feeling sad and drained out of blue, and suicidal thoughts -- thankfully (?) passive and intrusive -- has been more and more persistant and frequent. I'm talking myself out of them on a daily basis, but it would be unbearable to carry such a burden for long. 

  
I was far too idealistic to believe at least this internal disturbance could cesse temporarily some day. Now I feel like surrendering. I've been compliant enough and did have an intuitive belief, test and true along the way,  in my GP at the very first appointment with her. Why I've been trying to do things right but still no hope for me?

  
What's the point in treating depression at all? 10 years of my youth vanished into a mysterious mist. Unawared of and untreated depressive mood / depression from middle school until last August; formal diagnosis arrived almost like the long-awaited admission letter to Hogwarts. 



With all the relapses and recurrences, It would be incredibly insane to anticipate a fully asymptomatic life. Having consulted quite a few guidelines, textbooks and articles, I only wish to be okay, above and beyond, in my studies & possible academic life; I'd be happy to trade with my mental health, which to this point is already leaky.

499,I don’t know what to do with my life,"Hi, this is the first time i make this kind of post here since i have no idea to whom I should talk to about this anymore. Sorry for my bad english since english is not my main language.

There were couple of things that triggered me to have another relapse episode this month, and i don't know whether i can describe everything well. I really feel that my life is pointless, living alone in another country while surviving in between a part time job and also as a master student is hard. I know it's hard since the beginning but i just don't know that it's going to be THIS hard.

Living alone is hard, all i ever want since i was a child is having a 'home', but at this point idk whether i'll ever have one. Home in this context is not just about a place, it can be anything or anyone, but i never think i belong anywhere. I hurted myself last month already because i was tired and exhausted of living my life, and now, all that thoughts start coming right back at me again, and again, and again.

For the last couple of days i was bedridden and only went out once since i really do need to go outside my room just to see the world, the environment, but still i feel hopeless, i feel that nobody can save me anyway since i know we're the only one who can save ourselves in the end.

I was diagnosed for having a BPD 4 years ago, and right till this moment idk whether i already accept that, or not. I really hate myself and my own self destructive thoughts to the point that i can't bear living with these thoughts anymore, but at some point whenever i want to hurt myself i still think of my friends and my sister who will be very sad once am gone or kill myself, and i don't want to give them all that burden, so i just choose to stay silent.

At this moment, all i do is just juggling and sacrificing my own study in order to be able to live here, while what i want is just pursuing my master in peace, but i know that i can't, so i just have to try to live with this destiny.

I dont know why some of my friends always try to tell me that they wish they have a courage and independence like me, while i even hate myself. I am not strong, i never was, the universe made me look like i am.

I really wish that i could just disappear from this world, i don't even feel loved anymore, so what's the point of trying to love and live my life?

Hope nobody will ever feel the same like i am.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1iu4eyg/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,Pum4G4tt0,1740073482.0,depression

I feel really down everyday and if I don’t cry I feel even worse but if I cry and let it out I feel a lot better. I don’t really have a reason to cry I just have an overwhelming sadness.

503,Am I trying to find a reason to pull away,"So I (21f) met this guy (24m) who I really like, whom I’ve been talking for about 3/4 weeks. The problem is he treats me really good, he buys me stuff, texts back fast, but he’s very sexual this early on. 

Well the other day I started to worry that he will stop liking me. Then, I started looking for things that might point to it like, maybe when he had to go home when we hung out it’s because he was just sick of seeing me. We also have been very sexual which he initiated, now every time we hang out he wants to do something sexual but he always takes me on real dates and pays for everything, but it’s just after that he wants to do something sexual. Normally, I wouldn’t have a problem with it because I have a high sex drive but I’m starting to wonder if he just wants sex and nothing more really. Like, that’s all this will become is just a sexual thing you know. And it’s so early on like three weeks, so I don’t know how normal that is since I’ve only had 1 other relationship, which we only started dating because he wanted sex.

I can’t tell if I’m valid for thinking this or if I’m just insecure because I’ve been recently feeling heavily like I don’t deserve to be cared about. And when he does nice things for me it makes me feel like pushing him away because I don’t feel like I deserve it. Or like, when we are together and taking pictures I don’t even wanna look at it, or for him to have it because I feel like I look like a monster. And then while we are together I look around at other girls and feel insecure because I feel like he should be with them and not me. Even my personality, I feel like I sound like an idiot or a weirdo and eventually he’s gonna figure out how ugly and weird I really am and stop liking me. And it feels awful because I constantly have this tightness in my throat that hurts so bad, and now it’s like I wanna stop talking to him.

Do you think my concerns are valid or just me trying to find a reason to push him away because I’m insecure?

507,My life is spiraling out of control,"I had a tooth filling fall out on Halloween. They checked my blood pressure and said I needed to go to the ER because I was about to have a heart attack because of how high it was. Went to the ER and got medicine. Dentist then said they can't help me until I fix my blood pressure. Months go by and both my dogs die. I crash my car. get 4 stitches in work related accident. I find out that I'm not getting a raise this year. I slowly start to recluse and become a hermit. Every time I talk to someone it seems like I said the wrong thing or my opinion sucks. I'm a blunt no nonsense guy with a monotone voice, so I'm use to that. Although it seems ten times worse now. It's like I'm a whackamole and every time I peek my head out, I get bopped. I bit a hard candy and broke my farthest back tooth. Thankfully my blood pressure is now under control so the dentist was able to pull it out after making me wait 4 days of excruciating pain. I brush my teeth every day before anyone asks. Pain from the tooth stops, immediately my back starts hurting. Pulsating pain for hours. Nothing helps. After 4 days I go to urgent care and they say I have stress related back spasms. They give me a muscle relaxant that does nothing and a hardcore version of Aleeve that just puts me to sleep. It's been almost a week with the back spasms. I can't go to work for more than a few hours without tapping out. The pain is unbearable and will not stop if I sit still. So I am forced to pace my house for hours, too in pain to even use my phone or read a book. baths are a few minutes relief before it starts again. massage gun works sometimes. I still haven't got my filling fixed.

-uncle had a heart attack and went into hospital
-new job is a toxic corporate work place (poor training and micromanagement)
-my cat sent gf to the ER. Got scared and swiped her face accidentally 
-moved twice, the apartments here are atrocious in price and quality (huge rodent and moisture problems)
-Since the moves, I have been paying all our expenses while GF focuses on studying. She's hoping to have a job by summer
-GF and my best friend hate each other after a fight


I'm honestly exhausted and depressed. I've signed up for some certificates and teaching licensing. I'm really trying to pull myself out of this. Despite my efforts, my GF says I am too deep in my depression and that it is effecting our relationship, that I need to see a professional. She's concerned I take naps after work and have been too exhausted to go out. She's right and I have an appointment scheduled. I've been exhausted from everything and trying to apply to jobs everyday.

I absolutely hate my job and will lose it in 6 months time, if not sooner. My only options then are to either be unemployed (not viable), make a career change and take such a big drop in salary that I can't support my family (also not viable), get another job doing the same thing (a fate worse than death), or kill myself before my contract ends so my employer will pay a big death in service sum to my wife.

I am so miserable 24/7 that I'm just doing such a shit job at work and people are noticing. At least if I kill myself they'll know why and not just think I'm incompetent. The thought of getting through another day of just coasting and bullshitting and saying or doing whatever I need to do to slip through just makes me sick.

Doctors and health services pretty much don't want anything to do with me, they're just playing hot potato with me passing me back and forth with referrals because I think they know I'm gone soon and no one wants to be the last one to deal with me when I go.

I literally have no one to talk to about any of this. Everyone wants me to just shut up and get on with it because ""that's just life"". My family is so dependent on me that even if they get a load of money when I die they still won't cope. My wife only knows about 0.01% of how bad I feel even though I've started trying to manage her expectations and let her know that this depression will get me one day.

517,Will I ever be successful in life?,"Hey everyone, 17M here. I'm in my second year of high school, grinding to change my future. I'm at a stage where I don’t really care about my life. I have no interests, no hobbies—nothing that excites me anymore. The only thing that matters to me is finding a way to be successful.  
  
I just want to make my family happy. I know they don’t like me, and being around me probably irritates them, but that doesn’t matter. What matters for me is taking them out of debt and giving them the life they deserve. That’s pretty much the only reason I'm still in this shitty world.  
  
I don’t want anything in return from them—not love, not care, nothing honestly. All I want is to be able to afford to give them a good life.  
  
Now This part might sound a bit specific, but I’ll try to explain it as clearly as possible.  
  
A few months ago, I discovered programming, and from that moment, I became obsessed. It was all I did, day and night. But after five months, I realized something—I still don’t know shit. I kept switching between different fields, never sticking to one long enough to actually learn.  
  
Then I finally settled on hacking. It fascinates me. It keeps me glued to my screen, eager to learn more. But for some reason, it feels like there’s something—or someone—out there that just doesn’t want me to succeed. No matter how carefully I do something or even follow instructions, something always goes wrong —always.  
  
Watching five different tutorials on how to legally access a vulnerable system, and all of them showing the exact same steps. Yet, it just doesn’t work for me. I sat there, staring at my screen, begging it to work—until I finally broke down.  
  
If I can’t even get this simple thing to work, what are the chances I’ll ever succeed? It defeats the only purpose of me still being alive. I see kids on YouTube, programming since they were seven-eight years old, and I can’t help but feel jealous. Will I ever be good enough?  
  
Every day, I feel like I’m sinking deeper into helplessness. I don’t know what I’m doing, if it’s the right thing, or if any of it even matters. I have no guidance, no support—no one to turn to when it gets too much. It feels like I’m stuck, running in circles with no way out.

Maybe I need to make friends but then again I have had bad experiences and feel better alone than be around others. I wonder if anyone can advise me I feel so low. I even try to go to the gym to distract myself it’s not as if I’m just lazy I just don’t know why my brain won’t give me a break. I then find myself thinking negative things about myself and I can’t take it I feel like I can’t take it anymore.

526,How do I know if the anti depressants are working?,"I've been on Lexapro 10mg a day for about 10 months. My psychiatrist increased it to 15mg in Dec so I've been on the increased dosage for about 2 months now.

I quit my job middle of last year because at that point I really couldn't cope with such a fast paced demanding job. I am more 'functioning' compared to my very early days of depression in the sense that I manage to sleep for a decent number of hours at night, I maintain my hygiene, can do regular things like read, keep a daily routine  - but I still struggle a lot with suicidal ideations, feeling like a burden, feeling useless , etc. I have been speaking to a therapist for about a year now which is helpful but has not magically done away with my depression.

Does it mean I need to change meds? I used to think getting a job again would solve everything but nowadays I doubt this. I'm  worried I'll resort to being a shell of a person, plus struggle to cope with the added stress of starting a new job. 

I really don't know how to gauge whether I need to continue to wait and see or take some other action. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1itxshx/how_do_i_know_if_the_anti_depressants_are_working/,Sweetpotato-latte,1740055983.0,depression

I just..

But shells are fragile, even the tiniest tap could break it and shatter it..

Who am I?

I'm a little girl who loves camping with my family, telling scary stories around the fire, climbing all over my dad, falling asleep in my siblings arms, listening to my dad's songs while we were walking, cheering my parents on when they were doing their races. I'm a little girl who loves to hug my family, the ones I love and care about. I'm a little girl who loves to have fun and make others happy.

I'm a little girl who's too scared to go out in the world.. I'm a little girl who doesn't want to move on from the past. I'm a little girl who doesn't want lose my family. I'm a little girl that's just scared and alone!!!! IM A LITTLE FUCKING GIRL THAT JUST WANTS HER FAMILY ALL BACK TOGETHER AGAIN!!!!! IM A LITTLE GIRL WHO WANTS TO GO PLACES!!!!!! IM A LITTLE GIRL..

529,I just can't do it,"I can't do it anymore. I know my friends and my boyfriend  (who I've been with since the 2nd) wants me around, but I can't do it for them. I haven't self-harmed for about a month until now. I cut myself a little yesterday and did a slightly bigger cut today; in fact I did it 10-15 minutes ago.

I'm lonely. Besides all my friends and boyfriend who's all online, I've got no one. I just want to talk, speak with voice and I can't if I have no one to talk to. I do talk with myself irl and occasionally here on reddit. Not talking to myself, but with myself, meaning that there's me and another version of me and we have conversations. 

Since my last post, I've been sexually assaulted at least two more times. Yeah, that's a month. And no, it's not my loving, caring boyfriend because we're doing a kinda long distance thing. Not just assaulted, but also harassed. 

Why do I keep living? Do friends need me? Am I really that good of a friend? What's stopping me from ending it all right now? All the pain. All the suffering. When does it end? Will it end on its own or do I have to deal with it? 

I don't have much meaning in my life, and definitely not enough to prevent this harm I've done to myself. My main reason to stay alive is to keep my boyfriend happy. He doesn't have much, but I don't care. I love him so much, and I want him happy. Even if that means me suffering from all of this and the rest of the world. I may not die and I may not get the happiness I've been hoping to get. But I will keep hurting myself.

535,Im truly lost.,"To start this off, im a avid drug user and been one for the better part of 4 years. I started because seemed fun and i was 15 didnt really know much about life and so on. But in the last 2 years ive just felt so useless and lost, ive tripped on acid a bunch and opened my eyes to the meaning of life and i really truly cant find it. Working your whole life to just survive is incomprehensible to me, why in the world would i do that?? Everyone who i see going out is living paycheck to paycheck and of course so am i its so demoralizing. 

I have no ambitions, no motivation, no want from life, no feeligs even, i dont really feel sad or depressed but more like numb, i catch myself overthinking about dumb things yes and that sometimes makes me a little sad but other than that im desensitized to everything. Ive gone to therapists they dont help, the antidepressants just help only because i feel like i took a xan and im “geeked”. The only good feelings i do get is from the drugs and idk what to do about it, i dont want to quit because my friend thats been sober for 2 years says that, yeah sure im sober but i dont nothing makes me feel like how i used to and when he wants to do something fun he says that it feels like somethings missing and its been like that since he got sober. I know im digging myself a bigger hole with it, but whenever i reallllyyyy trully have a urgent responsibility i have to do, i can do it even if im “geeked”.  When i take something it doesnt matter what, im always aware im conscious im hyper vigilant 24/7. Also last thing, ive ignored my problems so long to where, im not sure i even know why im like this.

538,I just can’t do anything,"How am I going to live life when I don’t have the energy to do absolutely anything? I’m so stuck, I’ve been depressed for so long and I’m not doing anything. I‘m in my mid twenties and still live at home. My parents keep telling me I need to move out, find a job, finish my degree etc. and I appease them by assuring them that yes I’ll do it soon, I’ll be done with school soon when in reality I’m not doing anything. 

And it’s not because I don’t want to. I have all these dreams of living in my own apartment in a different town. Dreams of having a boring office job just so that my life has some structure and meaning. And dreams of living in a different country, having my own business, meeting someone and starting a family, but that is so absurd that it’s always just a nice dream. Then I think back how I had every opportunity in the world when I left high school and I made nothing off it and now I haven’t accomplished anything except gaps in my resume and nothing to show for it. 

Every night I think, tomorrow I’ll get up early and I’ll change it around. I’ll do my school work, I’ll lock in, I’ll apply to jobs and get my life back on track, but then I wake up, snooze the alarm twenty times, feel like I haven’t slept in a week and getting out of bed seams impossible. The idea of leaving the house seems as unappealing as calling someone and telling them their dog died. It gives me anxiety. By the time I’m up and dressed it’s afternoon and it’s another day wasted. Then I tell myself again that I’ll do it tomorrow just to keep the anxiety at bay. I know I won’t do it tomorrow but the reality of that is unbearable. It’s such a mess. I don’t even do anything, I just lay there and daydream. 

How can I get out of this when I can’t even get out of bed? When I’m so tired two hours after waking up that I just want to go back to sleep? When going to the shop to get some food and eating it is all I can manage in one day? How the hell am I supposed to live life when that is already too much? In Highschool I wrote ten essays a week and now just the idea of writing one is so overwhelming. Even if I somehow manage to swallow my pride, tell my parents and drop out, what then? Start another degree? How do I get a job? I actually feel hopeless at this point and it gives me panic attacks on the regular. 

A while ago I mustered up the courage to see a doctor and tell them about the exhaustion and executive disfunction and they just said I need to just do things because everyone is tired and they still do things. That I should exercise more. I started running but again, if I manage to go for a run then that’s a full day event. I don’t understand how people have the energy to do so many things in one day. I think all this overthinking and anxiety is also taking away my energy and mental reserves but I can’t stop it.

If I go back home, I know exactly what I am going to do. But it’s going to be a very difficult journey, and I don’t even know if I will make any money from it. 

I don’t want to talk to my parents about what I am feeling cuz I already feel like a financial burden for them. My father just had his open-heart surgery, and I don’t want to bother them with my state of helplessness.

I currently live at my cousin sister’s place rent-free. But, she has her own son and family to take care of. Plus, I don’t have a car to go somewhere and spend my time doing something productive.

I have tried to remain strong, given what I have been experiencing ever since graduating. But I think today is the day I realized that all this time I have been depressed…

I don’t know what to make of all this. I feel embarrassed of this entire situation and that’s the only reason I haven’t told any of my friends about it. And, I don’t think they could relate to me anyways.

547,I feel like I am a shell of my former self,"One of the hardest parts of depression for me is mourning the person that I used to be. I just turned 24 this week and I’ve been thinking nonstop about how much better of a person I used to be. 

I used to have close friends and a great social group that I talked to or spent time with every day. It felt so effortless to talk to them and feel comfortable around them. I used to be much more confident in myself and was happy with who I was as a person. Nowadays there is not a single thing that I can say that I like about myself. 

I just recently graduated college but I feel no joy or any hope for the future. I have no ambition anymore. I am still living with a couple of my friends but I find myself feeling like I am becoming more distant from them. I just don’t have the same spark and excitement for life that I used to and the fact that I dislike myself makes it a lot harder to connect with other people or even want to make connections in the first place.

I haven’t been in a relationship in almost two years now and honestly I have no desire to get back into the dating scene. Part of me does still want to find that connection again but I don’t want to burden someone else with my issues. It wouldn’t be fair to them.

I’m just not really sure what to do anymore. It feels like I’ve been depressed for too long now and am too far gone. I know that’s not necessarily true but it hurts me every time I think of how happy I was just a few years ago. I wouldn’t wish these feelings upon anyone. My dad suffered from depression and took his life when I was only 13 and sometimes I feel like I am destined to follow in his footsteps.

553,"""It'll get better""... but then it'll get worse again. Right?","I (22 F) live with my mum and I'm fortunate enough to have a really close relationship with her. But whenever I enter another near-crisis point and we talk about it, she'll say something like ""it'll get better. It has before, you've always bounced back."" But that makes no sense to me, because yes she's right in that it does get better... for a bit. But when I'm in that moment venting and crying, surely that's proof in itself that things get worse again too? Like yeah, I know things get better. But they get worse again as well. Whenever I'm feeling a bit more mentally stable, I'm still just waiting for the moment when ""it'll get worse"".
When I have these conversations with my mum, I now know to not mention my views about it getting worse again because we end up getting nowhere so it's easier to just agree.

554,It’s really hitting me hard,"So I’m the type of person to hold my feelings in and they build up and build up to eventually I explode. I feel like I have reached my snapping point. Being a toxic relationship I can’t seem to walk away from and a boyfriend who I don’t even want to get into it without feeling like I’m just talking shit but let’s just say we breakup well he breaks up with me constantly and my life has been sort of controlled since we been together. I feel like I’m not truly accepted as the person I am. Anyways to get back to the point we had plans to drive a few hours away to SF for an upcoming concert and we had just got in a stupid fight over stupid breakfast and he told me he wasn’t going to go. This is a huge issue for me due to the fact of always feeling like anytime he has done something nice for me or we have something planned something goes wrong and it’s ruined. For example going to the last concert he got angry I texted my friend to see if they were at the event and just walking outside to go smoke. I felt his entire attitude change towards me and it was later thrown in my face. So the anxiety of the stress of this or even our last trip to at which also ended in a fight and us not talking for three hour drive home has just got my anxiety, stress, and depression skyrocketing. Certain things we do going certain places, family events their important to me and since like 90% of our holidays were ruined in one way or another I keep waiting to make a happy memory hoping it will be chance to kind of have a fresh start. But it always has happens like the bad days outweigh the good by far. So with all this being said I was so excited about this concert I asked for the tickets for my birthday/Xmas present months ago. The artist is one of my favorites whom I listen to almost in a daily basis. I was so excited but after him threatening to not want to go I feel so depressed. There are def other factors as well like being apart from my two dogs and my one small chihuahua gets separation anxiety and will cry for me or the fact all my makeup went missing cleaning out the house I think it may of gotten thrown away. Then the fact I am gonna get up at 6am and drive home 3-4 rt away and now his brother wants us to wait in sf for breakfast before he flies out of town. Which is fine really. And there’s the fact I get super car sick. So with all this factoring I’m and our fight yesterday. A wave of depression has seriously veiled over me. To an outsider it all seems trivial and minot but to me especially because we rarely do anything like I don’t even leave the house ever it’s had a huge impact on me. I literally keep crying in waves. So usually I am extremely forgiving and get over things quickly but with all of this I’m so hurt and disappointed I will just be watching a show one sec and then the tears keep streaming down my face. I think I’ve held in my emotions for so long that they are literally exploding out of me. I feel so stupid for being so upset like this and it almost bothers me more that he doesn’t even seem to be phased by it at all. It’s like this one little thing has had such a fucking toll on me. So after fighting he said he still wanted to go but then told me to hurry up and get the fuck out almost immediately after he fights with me rages out kicks me out then always apologizes asking me to come back or work things out but he’s been doing this out entire relationship over almost the last two years. I’m so upset by it because i literally pack I own into my little van then have to unpack I mean at one point it was happening 2-3 a week I always was so forgiving about but now I’m just so tired of forgiving like you can’t say your sorry for something and just keep doing the same thing over and over, because eventually it’s just words. I understand when you young toxic relationships are almost a given but he is a 35 year old man with a bachelors in psychology. I constantly feel put down, controlled, manipulated, gaslight or even love bombed. I know at some point enough is enough but I keep hoping things will change and facing the reality that they probably never will is also very very depressing. It makes me not trust or believe anything he says. I don’t want to do I don’t know how to stop tears flooding down my face. And it messed up but it upsets me he can go about his day as if nothing is wrong. Yesterday in the midst of out fighting he was hanging out playing cards laughing while i literally had to lock myself in the room so nobody would see me cry. I know this a long vent but just curious of what should I do.

556,I don't want to be suicidal,"I'm so tired of being suicidal, I really don't want to die. I want to believe that things will get better, I really do.

But I know nothing will change. I'm 20 years old, I've been miserable for as long as I can remember. Isolated by my family and bullied non-stop, outright told by close friends that they don't care about me, etc. I'm so isolated, and I've been hurt so badly so many times I can't trust anyone anymore. 

I'm so tired of being burnt from getting close to people. I've heard it all a hundred times, ""you don't need to trust me right away,"" ""those other people are assholes for hurting you like that, I'd never do that to you,"" ""you can trust me I would never do something like that."" Words are so meaningless to me now, I don't think there's any way, any combination of words and actions that would ever let me trust someone again. I'm completely isolated. 

I have so many self esteem issues in so many ways that I barely even myself as a human being anymore, I'm beyond pathetic. Everyone around me has made sure I know that, and the deeper I get into my emotions, the more I realize that's exactly right.

My life just simply sucks on every level. Two shitty jobs, a shitty roommate, a shitty apartment, a shitty family, no friends. Hell I've been sleeping on an air mattress for almost 6 months now, which is around the last time I had an actual meal as well.

I know nothing will get better, but i really do want it to. Everything comes down to being isolated and shut out my whole life, and I'm so afraid of being hurt like that again that I just can't being myself to change that fact. I'm alone and will be until I die.

I'm thinking of suicide because I just want the pain to stop.

It feels as if life around me is moving at warp speed and I am simply not moving at all. The past is littered with regrets and the future has no light to it whatsoever.

559,Danger to people,"I became a danger to people

Since I first thought about committing suicide when I was 12, I can't seem to stop thinking about it.
Sometimes I act on it, sometimes I don't.  I try not to.
But lately it has gotten worse. It clouds my mind 24/7. I avoid going out with anybody, because I just don't seem to care if I did it right in front of somebody, somebody I love and who loves me. Like, I could just take one more step forward in the busy road, or one more step off the edge. I constantly have to force myself to ignore it.

Now I'm doing my drivers license. And a bit ago I was in a car with my mom and sister, we had a day planned out just for us three: drive around so I practice, have lunch at a restaurant and do some shopping. It was a nice day, though I ruined it with my mood. I'm sorry mom, I know you meant well.

While driving back I felt my chest getting heavy and tight, more and more with each minute. I wasn't thinking straight and I was driving. All I kept thinking was, how easy car crashes happen. And there I was driving a bit over 90km/h on a road full of turns near a deep river. There was a right turn ahead of us. And my foot just kept on pressing on the gas pedal and if I am honest, I didn't intend to turn or slow down. I just wanted to drive straight into the wall. If the impact wouldn't be strong enough to kill me, the car would surely be thrown into the water and I would drown.
My mom had to tap me on the arm and call out my name a few times before I snapped out of it right before the turn.
If I were alone,  I wouldn't have made that turn.
But what scares me is the fact that in that moment, I really didn't give a fuck if we all died.

562,M 19: Just came to the realization that life has no meaning and I won’t be able to make any significant impact regarding its worst problems :(,"For background info, I’m an environmental studies major with a minor in political science. I’ve had the notion that my life has no meaning for the last few years, but it was highly accentuated after watching both the Avatar movies. I was left hollow and devoid of any motivation/hope. Even though these movies are fiction, the humanity they depict is strikingly accurate to our current species, just at a later stage. I realize that the larger mechanizations of this planet are far beyond my scope and I will likely have zero impact on the problem. Global warming, pollution, destruction of species and habitat, urban sprawl, etc will all continue through my lifetime. These activities are driven by massive interests groups, which are bad enough as it is, but more worryingly, by the basic desires held by most/all humans. Everyone wants a house, everyone wants an iPhone, everyone wants clothes to put on their backs, everyone wants a car. Not only do we want these things, but most of us can’t afford to have them unless they are made cheaply. This is billions of people, across 100+ nations and there is legitimately no way I can ever hope to stop it. It’s become a terribly destructive feedback loop and the problem is that everyone benefits from it, not just the ultra rich. I know there’s the whole logic of “If everyone won’t try then nothing will get done.”, but the problem is that there are motivated and wealthy individuals that are trying to make a difference and it appears like they are trying to dry the ocean with a towel. As long as the current global/political order remains the same there is no feasible way to fix the issue. It would take a world government to fix a world issue, but that is not going to happen until it’s too late. Nations aren’t going to give up there sovereignty for a problem that won’t seriously effect until the next generations. People will still demand goods, companies will supply that demand, and life goes on. Even if I were to somehow fix the US’ footprint, that’s just one small component in a global issue. Fact of the matter is: humans won’t fix the issue until it’s already far too late. Hell, we’re diverting more money into exploring the stars for habitation than fixing my our own issues at home. The problem is too big and multifaceted, the actors too well funded and influential, and no one wants to give up their goods. I’m not grandstanding, I buy goods too, and I’m part of the problem. I still recycle even though I know most of it gets thrown out anyways. I get paper straws even though I know it means literally nothing in comparison to a random textile mill dumping metric tons of heavy metals into a river somewhere. It makes sense why so many in the science community are fatigued and almost despondent. They know no matter how much research they perform, how many suggestions they make, how many articles they publish, they will be ignored by the larger fundamental desires of humanity. We want, therefore we destroy, and I can’t do anything about that.

564,I don't know... I just need to talk maybe?," For the most part I've gone pretty well numb to everything.  I mean Ive felt numb for a while but nothing compared to the absolute emptiness ive felt for the last 6 months or so..  I don't trust anyone anymore.  Not even myself.  I don't care about anyone anymore.  Not even the people who i once loved more than family.  I walk around with a blank stare just trying to get through the day.  I've tried meds and therapy and nothing helps. But every once in a while I get a reminder of my former friend.  Usually just an intrusive thought or memory but, last Sunday I saw this former friend at Walmart.  And...  he's a part of why I've gotten so bad.  He's the reason I no longer trust.  Because after over a year of being my only friend (im autistic.. and im not attractive, and i dont fit in anywhere,  our other friend ghosted me, my dad was dying and this person was quite literally all i had) he admitted he only pretended to be my friend out of pity. And that I'm psychotic and petty and childish and sad and depressing.  My therapist says it's not true.  She says he's a horrible person and it's not my fault.  But how is it not my fault when everyone always leaves me without even giving me a reason.  This guy, for example, said all that horrible stuff, then tells me I'm ""a good person and he likes who (i) am"" but then he never spoke to me again. Anyway, I approached this former friend once at work months after our friendship ended.  I apologized for whatever i did wrong, just hoping we could talk like adults.  I didnt expect him to welcome me back to his life as a friend.  But...  i didnt expect him to turn his back on me either and thats exactly what he did... one of my autistic traits is craving a reason for why things happen, even when there isnt a good reason i crave some sort of understanding.  i just wanted to know why he went from texting me daily calling me ""sis"" or ""love"" to not talking to me for weeks at a time, and then, to telling me he was only pretending to be my friend and... everything.  If I'm truly a good person like he says... what i did wrong?  But he didnt even acknowledge me.   And I grieved for a long time before I stopped feeling anything.  At first it was random and sporadic. But now it's constant.  To the point I'm seriously beyond ready to end it.  But every once in a while it's like.. a certain memory comes to mind.  Or.. like Monday I saw him at walmart and I thought about  how weird it was that we used to tell eachother everything and now he wouldn't even acknowledge me if I even tried to say  hi to him and just...  it feels like my heart stops working and my chest gets tight and the only way i can get it going is with a forceful l coughing fit.  And thats usually followed by a severe panic attack or an absolute break down where i can't stop sobbing for hours or days.  I hear it's a common symptom in broken heart syndrome if thats a real thing.  But im curious if anyone else has experienced this and if there's anything that helps..  it's starting to really hurt.  I feel like my chest is achy all the time now..  thats the only thing I feel.  There's no emotion.. Just a dull ache.  My heart no longer feels like a heart. It just feels like a cold lifeless lump and I can compare the coughing fit to being like a kid poking it with a stick saying ""do something"".  What do I do?  I'm trying to get better.  I'm fostering a dog. I take him for long walks. Or did. Hes now recovering from his neuter so for now we're on break.  But I didn't feel anything but tired and sad and lonely during or after our walks.  I'm back in touch with a friend from 20 years ago who i haven't talked to for 8 years..  but I just... keep waiting for him to get sick of me and leave me again too.  I don't trust him.  I can't trust anyone.  I've tried multiple therapists but..  none of them understand or help.   This most recent one at least tried but the last I heard from her was some typo I couldn't understand and she hadn't reached out since and she's sick of me too im sure.

567,Me Before You as a depiction of depression,"I just finished watching ""Me Before You"" and I found myself deeply struck by the movie, the emotional climax of the film and the dialogue that went with it hit me very close to home. I'm not quadriplegic, nor disabled outside of my mental illness, but after a very rough end to last year and start to this one I found that Will's dialogue explaining his rational for following through with his plan to die rang very true to my own experiences trying to push through depression throughout my life but especially these last 6 months or so, It scared me a little bit. I'm safe of course, and of course this is only media, but it sucks that I as a generally healthy 25 year old dude am ready to pack it in already. It's no one's fault, it just is what it is at this point, and I've accepted that.

I know people love me, and it hurts, it sucks so bad because I know that people have chosen to be tied to me. I know these same people deserve better, someone who can properly and appropriately appreciate the love that they give. Love helps of course, and I do my best to repay everything I can, but it doesn't change the fact that it almost always feels like I'm fighting to keep pushing forward gritting my teeth for every inch I move and fighting tooth and nail to resist the urge to give up entirely. I'm forever trying my best to be human when all I want is to be a corpse.

Here's a transcript of the climax I've mentioned: ""and that is why I can't have you tied to me. I don't want you to miss all the things that someone else could give you, and selfishly I dont want you to look at me one day and feel even the tiniest big of regret or pity... But I need it to end here No more pain and exhaustion and waking up every morning. Already wishing it was over. It's not going to get better than this.""

Sorry if this is poorly written. I just wanted to share I guess. I'd be interested to hear everyone's thoughts on this too of course.

576,how to get my spark back?,"i struggle with severe depression. i've struggled with this my whole life, ever since i was little. i suffered from bullying from first grade until my senior year of high school, when i dropped out halfway through it, and was diagnosed with cptsd. this was in 2023, got my cptsd diagnosis last year.

i am now a university student, going into my second year. last year was filled with changes: for the first time ever, i felt welcomed. i made many friends. i got the best grades of my entire life, maintaining a 4.0 gpa , and i started a stable and positive relationship in february. but, here is when the problem starts (or gets worse): my now ex partner broke up with me in october, because we were both struggling a lot with pour own mental health problems. i won't go into detail about their problems, it's not my place, but i can speak about my own. my depression got really bad last year because of all the changes, i was constantly triggering my cptsd, my anxiety levels were through the roof, always scared, and i also suffer from an eating disorder (i've had it since i was 10 years old, i'm now 19), and being in uni just worsened it, i live with my family but i spend the whole day in university, studying and hanging out with friends, so i was able to get away with my disordered habits without my parents noticing. also, i started showing signs of ocd (in the process of getting a proper diagnosis, but both my therapist and psychiatrist say they're pretty sure i have that), which made me get obsessed with my grades, studying, and my weight and appearence. i wanted to be ""perfect"" all the time, because i finally had a good life, and genuinely believed that i had to be a certain way to maintain it, my friendships, grades, and my parents respect, which i finally got after years of having a bad relationship with them due to my school grades and their perception of me as a lazy person, when i was just struggling mentally. 

when my ex broke up with me three months ago, i stopped feeling alive. the moment they left, something died inside of me, i snapped, and fell into a deep depression, i spent a week bed bound, unable to eat or drink anything, and on the eight day after, i got taken to the er by my parents, who wanted me to be admited into a psychiatric ward, biut i wasn't admited, so the next day i went back to uni, and i started to spiral. my obsession with my grades and my body got worse, i started hanging out with all kinds of people, i made lots of friends (or so i thought), stayed out until it was dark every day, because i knew that, the moment i got home and was alone with my thoughts, i would start sobbing uncontrolably and get really negative thoughts. my ex blocked me on everything, and there's really no chance of getting back together, trust me, i've tried EVERYTHING.

i started journaling, going to the gym, going clubbing casually (it's been four times in three months, nothing excesive), having self care days, i literally tried everything, but still, i haven't felt alive. i've been dissociated this whole time. it all feels like a dream, more like a nightmare.

i've been on summer break since november, and i'm going back to uni in two weeks. i want to get my spark back, i NEED it. i want to feel alive and happy again, or at least, feel like myself, like a person, not a shell of the girl i once was. i have no one to trust. i need help, tips, anything. i'm desperate.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1itl4l8/how_to_get_my_spark_back/,fucknaomz,1740010770.0,depression

581,I'm very lonely and I need to ramble about how dark it is,"I haven't really vented like this in a while. Like I have friends and  I'll have my down moments in which I'm honest but I stop myself from sharing just how dark my life feels.

I honestly am just living my days waiting to die. If I could just be forgotten by everyone that'd be nice so I can accelerate that process. Years ago I moved to a different continent to escape my old life and inauthentic relationships and build my own life here. What did that create? Well it just ended up with me constantly fighting an uphill battle of trying to establish new authentic relationships, whilst still trying to respect the old bonds I have- such as with my parents.

Funny how I care a lot about how they feel knowing I'm alive and well, but they'd never accept me from what I am. So I have to maintain this weird relationship where I reassure them everything's ok while having to deal with how their love is purely conditional and I have yet to know love that isn't insanely conditional. So I fight my way to try to be the best at everything I can be and my God it's so so exhausting. I know I can't attain perfection but I feel the standards I have needed to set to myself in order to form and maintain my new relationships is so insanely high. And then comes the jealousy. Great I have these friends but their lives are just so... Full. This person goes home to his wife because she's having a rough day, this person is visiting his parents because they're helping him out, this person is planning out a worldwide trip with their best friend... And then there's me. I know people's lives aren't perfect and I just have one perspective but still. 

I just have nothing, and noone. I live alone and my place is so quiet I have to sleep with the TV on so that I hear *some* life in my home. My finances are what I have built for myself and my career are what I've put my sweat and blood into and every single one of my friendships are ones I have needed to perfect myself to appeal to. 

The worst part is when someone tries to be empathetic but just doesn't understand what its like to literally have noone. It's this weird sick feeling like instead of going to sleep with a sense of safety and community, I'm going to sleep on rocks with one eye open because only I can watch out for myself.

I just don't know what I did to deserve to be born into this life that I didn't choose, be born gay which I also didn't choose, and just be born as me- someone who *has* to be perfect or else I lose what little I have. And trust me I've tried not trying my best- it did NOT work out.

If only my parents would completely forget about my existence so I can pass in sleep because most days I think I don't fit in anywhere because I simply am a mistake- I do not belong, so why be here anymore?

It doesn't matter how many friends I succeed at making, non of them feel authentic. It doesn't matter how well I do at my career, it's the bare minimum. It doesn't matter how positive my family view me from afar, I literally moved thousands of miles away so I don't have to keep lying. I do everything that's positive that I can think of, yet it all feels so so pointless because deep down I know I'm just very broken and I feel my existence as a whole was not meant to be.

598,I'm still suicidal,"TL;DR: If anyone has advice for combating suicidal ideation, could you recommend me some tips? If you feel comfortable ... thanks.

I apologize in advance for the ramble ahead.

I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 13ish, and I really struggled with suicidal ideation/suicidal thoughts. I was really, really deep in my depression, and it's been a continuous, strenuous uphill battle ever since.

Other than my therapist, I have nobody to talk to about this. I've taken ""fake it till you make it"" too seriously, to the point that everyone in my life, including my parents and others closest to me, believe that I'm ""over"" my suicidal thoughts and that they're a part of my past. They're not. They're very much present, they just exist in the back of my head and I force myself to not pay attention to them. Force myself not to think about it, even though the thought crosses my mind at least once a day (and it gets worse whenever my mental state fluctuates), because the more I pay attention, the worse they get. The more serious I become about it.

I lost my will to live many years ago. I've fooled myself into thinking that I want to be alive (again, ""fake it till I make it""), but I'm only really still living for the sake of others. I'm my mothers only child, and it would absolutely crush her if I went through with it. There are people that care about and love me, and I have reasons to stay alive (success, a promising future, potential, etc)... you'd think that'd give me reason to want to live for myself, but it doesn't. 

I'm exhausted. I suffered psychological/emotional/mental abuse my entire childhood - I was brainwashed, essentially, and ever since I was removed from that situation, I've been on my healing journey. I'm aware that healing takes time and that I'll likely be recovering for the rest of my life, but I'm so fucking tired. I don't want to live with this constant exhaustion anymore. Every day, I have to fight my own brain so my depression doesn't take over; one wrong thought, and it creeps in and consumes everything. It's taking everything I have to not return to the ""comforting sadness"", because I know it's worse for me in the long run, but at least there, I got some semblance of rest.

I know a lot of this is rambling, and I'm sorry. Like I said, I don't have anyone to talk to about this other than my therapist, and I've moved provinces for school, so I can't see her as often as I used to - and Ive only recently stsrted being truly honest with her because of my raging trust issues, and I haven't built up the nerve to tell her the extent of all of this yet ... she's aware of the ideation and my history and has likely put together that I'm not as recovered as I think I am, but I haven't come outright and said it; I'm lying by omission. I know I'm holding myself back with this, but I physically cant force myself to talk about something if I dont feel ready. 

I've come here to request advice for how to deal with my suicidal thoughts, if anyone has any. All I've been taught is how to ignore them or distract myself, because if I think about it for too long in any capacity (i.e. listing reasons to stay alive, thinking of reasons to live, accomplishments I want to achieve, etc.) I start seeing it as the answer to everything, and otherwise undermine the value of everything else so that it *is* the answer.

So, if anyone has any advice on how to combat them, it'd be greatly appreciated. If you read the long ramble, I appreciate that too.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1itptlx/im_still_suicidal/,lumpycurveballs,1740024850.0,depression
599,Marriage problems,"Hello all, posting this to seek advice on my current situation. My wife and I have been married for a few years, 5 to be exact. At the beginning of our relationship everything was great, she was loving, showed support, and the thought of spending the rest of my life with her made me extremely happy. There were a few instances when we started dating that raised some red flags like extreme aggression, attitude, and irrational behavior. I thought nothing of it and overlooked everything because my feelings for her were so strong. At this point in time, I feel like I should have approached the situations and followed through with some communication to get some clarity. Fast forward, we are married and unfortunately experienced two horrible pregnancy losses, one being a stillbirth. This absolutely devastated both me and my wife. I began to learn that my wife suffered from severe depression for quite some time and these events severely exacerbated it. She had mentioned depression quite a few times prior to the events but me being the naive person I am I thought ""depression is depression, everyone is a little down and out sometimes."" After doing more research on how serious depression is, I tried my best to be a shoulder for her to lean on and took the situation alot more seriously. She has a big problem with me overlooking when she mentioned depression and doesnt let it go saying ""i told you it was serious, you never listened etc"". I am extremely mad at myself for not looking into it when she first mentioned it, and I voiced that and apologized. She decided to take a break from work for a while and I fully supported it and reassured her that her mental health was priority. She has been prescribed meds for her depression but has recently stopped. We have a few good days, then bam, we end up having a blow out. I am finding it extremely difficult to deal with mood swings and her constantly needing space. Im trying my best to have patience and be there for her. I suggested marriage counseling to get some input from an unbiased person and there is no follow through. (Her insurance covers couples therapy so she needs to do the legwork to set it up). Every time I bring it up I am met with ""what do you expect to get from it"" or ""how do you see it helping?"" I am desperate at this point and do not know how much longer I can hang in this for.

600,Depression took something from me.,"I want to start by saying english is not my first language so please excuse any mistakes.

I remember starting feeling depressed at about eleven years old (im 22 now) and it's been this way ever since. It's been ten years from that and I can definitely see some improvement, I used to self harm a lot and have tried commiting suicide, and throughout the years I had a ton of therapy and took a ton of meds, but I can't help feeling that I've lost something along the way. The depression is not bad or as intense as it once was but I don't feel the same as before and I fear I never will. I often have good days now, which is something that didn't happen frequently, but something is WRONG. Its like depression took a part from me that I will never be able to recover and, even when I feel happy, I can always feel the empty space that it left behind, and there are times when I can even physically feel that pain, that scar. I don't know why this happens and I can't put a finger on what exactly is missing, but I know it's supposed to be there.

This makes me think that there's no point in living because I will always feel like this, there's no escape. I have achieved nice things in life but the happiness I get from those things is not ""pure"", it's always contaminated by this horrible feeling. It's like I never fit anywhere and I'm always pretending to be okay and ""cured"" when I know something didn't heal right. I always make up some stupid excuse on my ""bad days"" when people ask me whats wrong cause I'm too embarrassed to explain all this and, after all, I don't even know what to answer them.

I don't know if this is the right space to talk about all of this, I just needed somewhere to share it before my own thoughts choke me to death.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1itpr08/depression_took_something_from_me/,Kind_Chart_7167,1740024613.0,depression

I've always tried to be a good person, and treat others how I'd want to be treated, often at the expense of my own wants / needs. I am all sorts of messed up, had depression since I was in my early teens, a dysfunctional broken family, not close with any of my family as they all overstep boundaries and don't treat me well. I don't have any really close friends, as any that I have had became bad overtime (I felt like they were taking advantage, I always made more effort, any time we'd talk I'd barely get a word in as they'd talk non stop- something that my family do that drives me crazy). My marriage is falling apart, following the birth of our son, due to our terrible communication, and I think he's not liking the fact that I'm becoming more vocal about the things he does that hurt me, which makes him more and more defensive, driving a bigger wedge between us. I feel I have no one I can rely on, who genuinely cares about me, who treats well. So I'm starting to wonder, is the problem actually me and I'm just oblivious to it? Is it possible that I'm just incredibly lucky that all the people I have got close to during my life have all been emotionally abusive?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1itplp2/whats_wrong_with_me/,TRP8610,1740024131.0,depression

I really do want to tell someone about this but I just can’t bring myself to. I’m hoping I’ll find something that will help me solve what I am feeling all by myself but I don’t know if I can do that without help. It’s just been extremely difficult and I don’t know what to do.

I feel like my existence only serves purpose to be expended by others. I feel worthless, miserable, broken, helpless, drained, used up, and afraid.

606,Exhausted from trying to manage my habits,"Hi, 

I posted this in another sub, but I am wanted to know if I was the only one who experienced this.

I'm a college student living in a student rental on my own and needing to pay for everything living with a minimum wage and barely getting by. 

I have a couple of things that I want to improve like my sleeping habits, exercice, eating patterns, studying patterns, house keeping patterns, grocery shopping, time management habits to be on time, etc. I'm trying to manage them to be able to have some sort of control over my life because when everything feels chaotic, I get anxious.

Dealing with this on top of my ADHD and the social and societal expectations put on people like me. 

Plus the guilt, shame, anger, frustration and sadness that comes when I don't manage to do those things because they're beneficial for me. When I fail to do them, I get super guilty and ashamed of myself because I know they're beneficial for me. I'm trying to let go of this and to channel this guilt into a strength to push me forward to keep going and to forgive myself.

With my studies, I can never say I am on top and caught up with them. There's always something that is still left and needs to be done, and it stresses and exhausts me out. 

I'm overwhelmed and constantly feeling like I can never just relax sometimes. I just want a break from my brain and my studies.

619,how can i help my partner who struggles with severe major depressive disorder and feels hopeless about everything?,"remove this if it isnt allowed!!! 

i figured maybe posting here could be helpful

my partner, 19M, has struggled with severe major depressive disorder long before we met, which was in september of 2023. around august/september 2022, he was hospitalized after trying to end his life and was almost successful. he was in a mental hospital twice for a few weeks (all within the same two month span) and im pretty sure his experience there has made him really fearful of being admitted again for his self harm and being suicidal. 

my partner has expressed that he feels hopeless, like hes been trying for the last five years (since his depression reared its ugly head) and that nothing has changed. he hates himself and doesnt feel passionate about anything, thinks that he ruins everything he loves, like everything he does to try and be happy ends up falling apart. 

this caused issues for us, and we broke up for a month in december and got back together this january. my own issues have become apparent to me and im getting better at learning how to not take his depression personally and let it reflect my self worth (i.e. feeling like im not enough for him to be happy, etc) and i feel like im getting to a better point where i can be supportive and help him get where he needs to be.

my partner is currently on lexapro and goes to therapy, but i think his meds arent working anymore and his fear of being hospitalized makes him not open up all the way to his therapist.

i already do my best to motivate him with words, push him when im there in person (i live on my college campus during the week and we’re an hour away), be encouraging, help him find things to make him happy, but im lost as to what else i can do besides taking care of myself

i love him so much and i want to help him find happiness and overcome this illness not just for our relationship but because i want him to be happy for himself.

I've never thought about sharing my life especially online but as hopeless as it feels I just want to leave a trace if that makes sense...

Sorry if I'm breaking any rules I just want to vent.
I'm 31 live in a semi third world country very conservative and religious (I'm not) which is one of many factors that made me withdraw socially I was a bright kid full of hope and dreams very well educated and knowledgeable and curious about life always did well in my studies.

Still have great social skills, it just feels extremely unappealing.
I grew up without a father started taking care of my mother at an early age because she started getting sicker and sicker over the years finished college with anxiety daily because of that.
Dealt with high stress and extreme pressure my whole life.

After college everything went downhill from there and it's been almost 10 years of severe depression and anxiety that put me in severe addictions.
4 years of daily benzo use, 3.5 years of daily codeine use 4 years of heavy cannabis use and 7 years of daily pregabalin use and the worst part is that I had to buy everything from the streets. I can't even begin to explain the shame and trauma that it has caused me I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
Because of that I lost everything that I ever had all my dreams my lifelong savings to gtfo from this shithole and so much more.

It's been 6 months since I completely stopped everything cold turkey and that's extremely dangerous and I think I have caused permanent damage to my brain. I can't enjoy a single thing anymore I'm still semi-functional and all of that because of my mother my sole energy if it wasn't for her I would've ended it all a long time ago in an instant.

I feel like I'm stuck between life and death and both are not an option anymore I can't take it anymore I've been jobless my whole life I've lost all confidence. 

Where I live addiction and mental illnesses are extremely taboo and I've never had or seeked professional help.

The withdrawals literally broke me unless you've been there you'd understand. I'd rather have my limbs detached and be tortured than relive those withdrawals. But I did it and I'm never going back.
I'm a lost soul without any future and I can't stop thinking about when the times comes when my mother dies. I don't know how to start my life again I have ruined my social image even though I've never done anything remotely violent or done anything illegal always kept my principles in check if you remove buying illicit drugs from it.

People who've known you just deeply pity you and speak about you like you've lost your mind when I'm a very well behaved and socially skilled person n adaptif to this shitty society who's extremely judgemental and has backwards views in various things.

It's extremely hard to start life again when you have a terrible life, I can't even move out. I couldn't care less about material things or food, I could eat bread and water for the rest of my life if I just had peace of mind. That's all I care about and I've lost hope in everything to be honest.

621,I have never been suicidal but I can't take it or continue living like this anymore,"Hey, this is my first reddit post (male/ 31 years old), I have sometimes wanted to post about my mental problem here but I was feeling so down all the time that I have always found it so hard to post anything. 

Yes, I have been diagnosed with depression, but after reading some of the posts here sometimes I start to question if it is depression or something else. I have never thought about killing myself so is the following really depression? And if it is, I appreciate ANYthing that is to be said (not necessarily help because nothing is helping me). 

My problem is that I feel so down ALL the time. Literally no mood or motivation to do anything in life. No energy or motivation to clean my room/ take the trash out, take a shower, go to the gym, work, write a reddit post...etc.

I got so lucky that I got a job as a boss in an electronic workshop (the old boss was retiring), so as a boss nobody observes what I'm doing and I'm alone in my office room feeling so down and lacking any desire to work on any task that is given to me, yet that doesn't matter because I work at a university so it is basically working with the goverment (not like working in a compamy) which means my deadlines are so loose and I can postpone however I like.

I also feel so emotionally needy that I installed 3 dating apps and payed for multiple subscriptions/boosts but I literally get 0 likes or matches. My pics are just me smiling in front of a river or a building (no activities or sports) which I have been told it doesn't make girls so interested. Some might say well do some sports/ take pics of you being active but I feel that I'm simply paralyzed by my mental illness. I can't do sports nor do I have the energy or the mood to change anything about me. I once (and only once) talked with a hot girl on a dating app and she kept sending me voice messages that I thought it was not a scam and I noticed a significant improvement in my mood, however 3 days later she asked me to invest in financial markets so I blocked her. 

I know that trying to get in a relationship  a bad reason to get out of low mood and I know no girl would want to get in a relationship with a depressed man but I keep insisting on doing so, as I am desperately looking for a way to improve my mood (no sense I know). 

I spend my day in the office watching live streams of League of Legends, drinking coffee all the time, scrolling through bumble or others hopelessly and desperately. I struggle to do the smallest tasks and even reading some posts here about depressed people is a hard thing to do for me. I get highly overwhelmed by any new task that I get in my workplace. I have tried to do small steps at a time but it doesn't always help. 

I have been to psychiatrists for 3/4 years and been on zoloft 200 mg but it ain't helping shit. Mood in the dumpster and overwhelming feelings all the time. 

This must be depression right? Even without suicidal thoughts or feeling sad? Even if it is, I appreciate anything that you guys would like to comment about my situation, which doesn't need to be helping comments, as medication is not helping, I struggle to do even anything to help myself and I have completely given up on my situation getting better or changed. For example you want to share something similar or talk about your problem it is appreciable because it makes me feel I am not alone and makes it easier for me to see other people struggling. If you want to help I appreciate it but I don't think anything will help me.

Firstly, I failed my first semester of University due to mental health issues. Then in second year (now), I fell back to the pit I fought so hard to get out of and now I am on leave of absence and will restarting my second year in September (again). It's not even that my major is difficult either, I'm a Fine Arts major. I'm currently on leave of absence and working part-time retail but picking up overtime whenever I can on average getting around 30hours per week. My therapist said I was on road to recovery but today I had a relapse, I broke down and everything came back. I'm such a failure, I can't even complete an easy creative degree, which in the end will still end me up in unemployment or being stuck in retail. I regret it so much. Most of all I hate how I failed my parents, if it weren't for my parents I wouldn't be here anymore.

626,Hi guys,"I'm just in some very dark place rigth now , i am not gonna hurt myself or anything for clarification but wtf ia going on in this world rigth now. Working as Barmen shows me some very dark sides of Humans in so many ways , i worked my whole life in this industrie and seeing year by year people and the world getting colder day by day and i cant handle it anymore. Normal stuggles in life , family problems and stress from friends is something wich is normal i am aware of it and ofc working on youself , improving you health , loving youself , hydrate and feed the body  and being  good decent Human with some sort of normal Moral code will help to get you out of dark places in life. I just checked reddit rigth now for some site that would maybe answer my Questions and i just tougth i'm maybe rigth here on this sub to post this.I'm breaking down rigth now , not sobing ,not in any harmful way i would say but mentaly , i just need to vent stuff . I can't handle the decline i feel , it's taking me down like some sort of swirl and no matter of hard i row it pulls me down. Job change is not a option , i love the place i work at sometimes it is hard to handle my boss and some coworkers are pricks but i would say 80% is based on good stuff. But there is something happening in the world wich i can't explain , out of 100 interactions 99 end in some negative way , everything is political or racial or about diversity , nothing feels special anymore. Everyone seems to have some sort of extreme idea about everything and you can't argue about it ,every movie , game or piece of literature i consume seems to be influenced by some sort of agenda (woke, rigth, left ,up ,down , whatever) so i decide to go back to stuff i grew up with not bcs it's better but for example Animation Movies , Masterpieces like Aristocats , Atlantis, Treasure Planet had all some sort of learning expierence that i learned something from even as i got older and rewatching stuff got me some new lessons in life but a lot of (not all of it ) the media today is corrupted by greed,agenda and is driving us apart instead of uniting us same for social media  . I have the feeling to talk to someone and having some sort of normal conversation is not possible anymore, why is there no middle way anymore? And why are people seeing everything in black or white and not in grey  , is it just me that is to much in is head or is there something happening wich is feelt by others aswell. This is the reason why i chose to write this down and post it here , i hope i'm not alone in this feel sphere , and it helps a lot to cope with some stuff by just writing this. I just want to know if there are people here that want to have a talk about whatever but with some normal moral values and logical arguments about this specific problem. I had some serious struggles in the past , 5 suicide attemps that went wrong ( lucky that i'm bad in causing harm) but 16 diffent therapy sessions have brougth me to a point 8 years ago  that i am happy , i build my House work my job love my life but it pulls me down again but this Time it is not by my own doing ( neglecting the body , not eating rigth , bad hydration , no body working like sports and to much dopamine overconspumption by social media etc) but rather i feel i can't control my fallback to a place i never want to go back to. So thank you for reading and if this post is seen by someone that is maybe in the same situation feel free to just leave the biggest Vent Text in the comments and i hope i will find some answers that help everyone in this sub , no one is alone on reddit end there is a sub for everyone!

627,hygiene & motivation pls help,"people who have lingering depression (not sure what the right term is), how do you keep up with hygiene? 

apologies if this doesnt make much sense, im just writing down my stream of thought. 

 - 21f, problem is i tend to leave the house 1-2 times a week and do not have the motivation/energy to keep up with daily hygiene for my own health when im not going outside the house.

 - VERY embarrassing to admit but for the last 2-3 years i havent showered or brushed my teeth **daily**. (maybe ill brush my teeth when i wake up)

 -i dont believe you could tell from looking at me as i look very clean and put together when i go out, but at home i feel like a little goblin rotting away.

 -Teeth wise when i go to my dentist they say everything is healthy which is unbelievable because i really do not take enough care of my teeth, but i know if i dont start now i will get massive issues when im older. 

 -other hygiene wise i find it v easy to keep myself very well maintained like hair, eyebrows, nails painted, shaving legs, skincare. also washing hands as im a germaphobe

 - blah blah blah point is, its the daily showering and brushing teeth which just seems like such a massive task to me. Im trying to start to better my life and i feel like this is a good first step?

 -if anyone else struggles with this/ has any advice pls lmk how to begin actually taking care of the basics for myself. It sounds like such a massive task for me but i know it'll make me feel better. 

I have followed advice online like buying things to motivate me such as new toothbrush/toothpaste, exfoliating gloves ect but this doesnt help day to day.

635,I dont see myself living to adulthood,"

Depression (and mental illness in general) has paralyzed me. Every day, I see people with their friends or boyfriends/girlfriends, being loved innately just for existing, and I get so sad thinking to myself: why is it never me? When will it be my turn to be loved? No matter where I go or what I do, I’ve never had the same love that other people have.

I do have some online friends I talk to occasionally, but I know it’s only out of pity. Now that I think about it, every friend I have online is only there out of pity. I don’t know how to become lovable and liked beyond that. I’ve tried—I’ve wanted the quality of being lovable my entire life—but I can’t tell if it’s me or if it’s other people who have the problem. No one outside of my boyfriend (online) sees the value in talking to me beyond a few words a handful of times every month.

Whenever I remember that nobody loves me in the same way that I love them, I feel a sharp pain in my chest, as if my heart is physically breaking. I can’t take the loneliness anymore. I know I’m not owed friendship or love—I know I’m not owed anything in life—but it would be nice to have a social circle, and I know I’m not wrong for desiring that.

And just to add on, my boyfriend could leave me at any time when he gets bored, and I’ve been abandoned and mistreated so many times before (in all forms of relationships) that it would be naive to assume I could be loved beyond being a guy’s fantasy or comfort. That seems to be the only way I can be loved unconditionally nowadays. But at least I’m good enough to be used, right? Ugh. Not assuming he is here, he's an amazing guy but i just dont know who to trust anymore.

I hope i dont seem ungrateful for my online friends though, im happy for them but ik they dont value me as much as their irl or other relationships in general since i only started making friends late last year from my venting posts.

 But in conclusion, This all just makes me feel like I’m not worthy or meant to be on Earth. If this is what my teenage years are like, as lonely and uneventful as they are, I can’t imagine adulthood.

643,Therapy is a sham for me,"Some time ago I was at the lowest point of my life. I just wanted help and I was proud of myself that I asked for it. My therapist, instead of talking with me about my problems, prompted me to use these idiotic therapeutic websites that taught mindfulness and all that crap. I just wanted to talk and vent. On top of that, my therapist suddenly started saying that I might be autistic. No one asked for a test, as it has a absolutely zero benefit for me to get diagnosed. But she pushed me to do this test. It consisted of all sorts of stuff, such as a talk between her and my guardian, an iq test (???) and all kinds of talks with me. Meanwhile, I wanted to leave therapy, as I thought that it was not benefitting me. Yet, she pushed and pushed to finish this autism test even thought no one asked for it.

After all was finished, she told me I was autistic. Which was something I was shocked about, as not a single soul has told me I showed any signs at all. I asked how she could conclude that. She said that my guardian said all kinds of stuff about my behaviour as a child. For example, that I was never good at accepting other kids' suggestions. (Which couldn't be further from the truth) All these remarks, I had no recollection of. I confronted my guardian about this and they said that the things my therapist talked about were not true at all. My therapist twisted all kinds of words. I don't know why. But she twisted the words of my guardian, and (I feel like she) fabricated all kinds of stuff to diagnose me with autism. I quit therapy after that.

I just wanted my depression to be helped. I wanted to talk to someone, yet she couldn't help it to just ruin my perception of myself. Telling me that my eye contact was stare-like. Which I have never ever heard from any other person ever. This horrible experience threw my remaining self esteem down the drain. I just needed help.

653,The thought of never doing what I love is overwhelming,"Hey, I’ve been feeling pretty depressed lately because I’m struggling to break through as a musician.

I won’t share my name since I’m not here to promote myself or discuss my music. The thing is, I have a really hard time performing live due to my anxiety, and thinking about it a lot recently has made me feel worse. On top of that, collaborating with other artists has been frustrating—many people communicate in a way that feels cold and unempathetic, which just adds to my discouragement.

I’d love to make a living from music because it’s the only thing that genuinely excites me. I’ve switched jobs multiple times (bookseller, copywriter, scriptwriter, journalist), but none of them felt meaningful—I only did them to get by financially. I know it’s unrealistic to expect to make a full living from music, but if I could at least earn enough to have just a part-time job on the side, that would be ideal. The idea of working full-time in something unfulfilling for the rest of my life is crushing.

For context: I’m 28 man from Slovakia, soon moving to Sweden, where I’ll start as a volunteer. After that, I plan to find work and housing and gradually get more involved in the local art scene. I have an anxiety and depressive disorder, take medication and attend therapy.

Kid is trying to go to school and have a decent life, in between scans for the cancer that may come back.

I'm trying to keep things afloat. The usual things. Money, food, insurance, bills, blah blah blah. It's a nightmare. It's also nothing special. People go through this and worse every day.

I'm on the edge between being a Boomer and Gen X. I had a rough time getting established, but I was able to do it. Now I'm watching prices rise faster than wages and seeing people struggle. I don't know how ""kids"" are supposed to get established. Things are far rougher than I had it. I also don't know how people who have problems and don't have a support system are supposed to get by.

I want to make things better. Not just for my family, but for others.

And I'm exhausted. Beyond hope at times. Forcing myself to pick up one foot at a time and keep going.

Please tell me that I can keep going and make things better.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1itbf6c/need_to_keep_going/,ThrowawayUmptyJilion,1739986788.0,depression
655,Nothing to live for anymore,"All my life I have felt this emptiness inside of me. All of my life nothing felt truly meaningful, nothing worth living for. Of course I sometimes I had phases where I found a distraction like a game, a show, a book or another hobby where I felt better even hopeful sometimes. But overall there has always been this nothingness. 

I grew up with my abusive single mom and endured severe physical and emotional neglect. I always told myself these feelings of emptiness they must be because I am being abused and neglected. I convinced myself I just need to become an adult and move out some day. This goal kept me alive. 

Well I moved out last year, went NC with my mother shortly after and at first I felt very relieved and excited. Finally I can live. Well, slowly but surely the emptiness started to take over though. I don't feel anxiety, sadness, desperation anymore like with my mom. Now there is only emptiness left. Everything that used to be enjoyable doesn't produce any happiness inside of me anymore. 

I feel so empty and lost. I'm lonely too. I don't have any friends. I don't have family. I'm basically all on my own. 

I'm in uni but I struggle to motivate myself to study because what is the point? What will change once I have my degree? Instead of studying I will just be working. But then what? What do I do in my free time? What is there worth living for? Nothing gives me fulfillment. 

I haven't felt this badly in years. I was suicidal from kindergarten until age 12 when I realized I can move out some day. I clinged onto this idea that I will not feel empty anymore once I move out. It gave me a purpose and kept me alive. But now I have reached this goal and there is only emptiness. 

I don't want to die but I don't know what to live for. Everyday I look at the clock on my phone waiting until it's time to sleep. I try to have fun, play games like I used to but it just doesn't make me happy. I go on walks but it doesn't feel worth living for. Time passes so slowly. There is nothing I want to do. I feel like I'm just waiting but waiting for what? Until I die? 

I feel so hopeless and lost. What do I do? How do I become happy? How do I endure another 50-60 years like that until I die of old age? ",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1it7ox5/nothing_to_live_for_anymore/,Opening_Pea7537,1739977835.0,depression

670,I can't forgive god,"TW: suicide, religion.

This is a vent.

I have experienced suffering to the extent that I cannot have faith or trust in god anymore. If I am allowed to think and feel, without covering up in false pretenses or suppressing it, then that's the truth. I resent and loathe god.

Believers are quick to bring up gratitude when I say this. Things like, ''oh, but god gave your LIFE''. Living isn't considered a good thing by everyone. I have always wished that I wasn't born. Because the negativity and suffering in my life has consistently and always overpowered any ''good'' that could come out of it, I didn't want it. Small things, here and there, sure, I can appreciate. Life as a whole? Big no.

I think I realize the reason why there is such a tone-deaf disparity between the common responses I received in the past and my experience is simply because most muslims haven't had the crippling experience of life that I've had. This is not intended to initate a match of the Pain Olympics, but I've been chronically depressed and suicidal since I was 10.

Contrary to common opinion, my suffering did not make life better. It didn't make me a better person. It simply made me want to end it. I firmly believe it was wrong, unjust, and completely unnecessary for god to inflict that on me. God could have chosen - at no cost whatsoever to themselves - to avert any and all of that suffering. None of the good he might have given me weighs anywhere near as much.

I understand why people become atheists now, or otherwise leave faith. It occurs to me that the vast majority of believers simply haven't had a similar experience of life. Their degree of contentment within their lives suffices them and their faith.

I thought the fire of misotheism in me had died out a long time ago, but it turns out if I'm being real with myself, I am still brimming with absolute rage and resentment for god. I blame him for just standing and watching from afar as he just *let it happen*. Over. And over.

680,"Doubts About My Wife’s Relationship with Her Brother is Destroying My Mental Peace – Am I Overthinking, or Is Something Wrong?","I (30M) have been married to my wife (30F) for over four years. We got married in 2020, and she comes from a lower-middle-class village background. Before marriage, I was sure she had never watched adult content or had any sexual experience.

The issue started six months after our marriage when she visited her parents' home for two months. When she returned, I noticed a sudden change. Earlier, we used to have sex regularly, and she enjoyed it, but after that trip, she didn’t seem excited about it anymore.

She also started talking to her younger brother (29M) much more than before. He is jobless and stays at home. Some things really disturbed me:

* She once curiously asked why my sperm is thinner, which seemed like an unusual question given her lack of prior knowledge.
* She also asked about my foreskin in a way that made me wonder how she even knew about such details.
* I noticed her brother touching her thighs while joking.
* A year ago, when I visited her home, I saw them clapping hands together and pulling away as soon as I moved my head towards them.
* When I confronted her on the next day while coming back, she started crying and refused to answer my questions instead of clarifying. She cried for three days, but never gave a clear response.

Now she has gone to visit her home again, and her brother will also be there for two days. My mind is going crazy with these thoughts. I don’t know if I am being paranoid or if something is actually wrong. I don’t think she was ever assaulted, and I know her brother is not manipulative. But my wife is very innocent and easily influenced by others.

I tried talking to her, but she shuts down and cries every time.

682,Being depressed is draining,"I have been depressed for the last 15 years of my life, but I been hiding it till the last 6 years. I been on pills but have to keep upping my dosage. 

What really kicked it off lately is I talked to someone that in the first time in a long time that actually made me forget about my depression, and it actually felt pretty bless. But my anxiety and overthinking brain messed everything up. 

Now I won't go into details as I know they lurk on Reddit at times, but I want to say if they never came into my life and everything I probably won't be here. But I want to say being this way isn't who I want to be. It's just draining every aspect of my life. 

I apologize if this doesn't fit the rules. But I need to post something somewhere to get it off my chest. I know I feel hesitation can ruin stuff. As it did for that person and our 'bond'. Just I feel and now deep down I know it sounds silly, but sometimes waiting on some people is worth it. Even if they don't think like 'your mindset'. 

I just want to wish I wasn't so depressed that it messes up my mind and way of thinking. I don't let anyone know because I was raised to be told to shut up and just keep everything to yourself. 

As no one cares about your problems and you need to just deal with it yourself. I just want to say they are indeed a breath of fresh air, and they are someone that seems to brighten the days even if the days seem lost. 

But hey being depressed and sometimes if you think if the world would be better without 'you' in it right? That's how I feel and think so much. 

To really be honest with one true self, if I could tell that person how I know our mindsets are indifferent, but when I talk to them it makes everything go away temporary.

I don't know if dating was easier pre-internet, however I find that most women in my age range (that I've met thus far) are varying levels of conceited and shallow. Coworkers, customers, and anyone I generally encounter for the most part bring some type of major personality flaw; it's been rare to come across anyone even wanting to say ""hi"", ""bye"", and anything like ""how are you doing, okay?"". I should correct myself; I've met people older that are also like this. Argumentative, gossipy, loud, yet they are surprised and cause a scene when others talk down about  *them *.

Would some of these people change the way they are years later, or will they remain the same? I've had a couple people try to convince me to be more positive, but I almost never find people worth meeting. Are there are women here who may have been the description above in the past but changed for the better?",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1it7rx0/im_curious_if_people_change_in_their_30s/,MakingMusclesNAmends,1739978047.0,depression

691,i don't want to get better.,"Not really sure how to do this, but ima go for it. a lot of people deal with this, so maybe some people can relate (though this post won't get any attention and is honestly purely for myself to rant)

I've been depressed for most of my life, and I'm so scared to get better. I’m scared to change. While I despise how continuously pathetic I feel, I have no desire to heal. No matter the situation, it’s always in the back of my mind, that I should be suffering. Even if I’m currently happy or excited, as soon as it comes down I’m back to my equilibrium. As soon as the laughter stops or the joke dies down, the awkward silence seeps in and I retreat back to my own depressing thoughts and self isolation.

Whenever I feel sad, I never distract myself or try to get out of the hole before I seep down. I always wallow in it. Just like Alex G said, “I just do what I do best when I’m down.” I create problems for myself even if there’s nothing to worry about. I pick out body language and perceive it as rejection, even if they just yawned when I was talking, or some other small thing. I tell myself I hate my friends one week and love and depend on them the next. (I do believe I have BPD - though I've never been with a therapist long enough to get this assessed or diagnosed unfortunately). I go from starving myself to binge eating, I cut myself partially to stop the sadness and to create more. I quit therapy 3 times saying it wasn’t working, while in reality I just didn’t want it to work. I told my last therapist that I feel like she was wasting her time with me, as I feel like I’m a lost cause. She didn’t truly care nor understand. No one does, and I’m not gonna pretend like there's someone who does out there, because while two people might have the same disorder or possibly be going through the same feelings, my suffering will always be mine.

I don’t see myself living long, truly. It's hard to say, but I just can’t imagine it. I have no long term goals that I’m working towards. I have no grand life-long project. I have no impact on the world, nor do I ever think I will with my sorry ass. Everything I do can be done by the next person. I provide no substantial merit in anyone’s life. My mother and father will get over it, my sister, too. Not like we get along anyway, and she’d be too young to truly care. I’m not gonna kill myself any time soon, but I will definitely be taking my life in the future. No question about it, unless (god forbid (btw i'm not religious)) something takes my life before then, which would honestly be disappointing. 

While I sometimes want attention and maybe sympathy for my internal suffering, I don’t want people pitying me. This is all in my control. I don’t deserve to be cared for when I’m actively causing my own downfall. I am causing all of my suffering, and honestly, I wouldn’t want it any other way. And that's the scary part, knowing that I'll probably never want to get better and this will be both inevitable and lifelong. I don’t feel myself when I’m not crying or depressed. It’s been so long that this isn’t just a phase, but a lifestyle. I live, sleep, and breathe this shit, and feel as if I'd go into a relapse with just one day of pure enjoyment. While this goes against literally everything I want from life, I just can't stop. I'm addicted to the high of the low, and don’t think there’s any coming back from this.

I know people agree with this. I actually believe that many depressed/struggling people can relate. While mental health is not only constantly being overlooked and seen as easier to deal with than it is, many people who have access to help just don't want to take advantage of it. It's become the norm in today's society unfortunately and it's hard to find an unstable person who's actively trying to help themselves without the intervention of others. I don't want it to get to that point, but at this rate I have no other choice. My only safe person, me, is against myself, and will cause my downfall. I'm my own worst enemy, and nothing is going to stop myself from finishing the job in the future.",7,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1isxhfy/i_dont_want_to_get_better/,diesel_gas,1739941071.0,depression

695,"I go through my entire life struggling in every way, I have no idea what life is.","I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and pts, officially, just recently. Both my parents are out of the picture and I’ve never had anyone to talk to. Trust me, no one.

I’m a grown man who is always apologizing, even when the situation doesn’t call for it, and even when I should be the one THEY are apologizing to. 

Since 3 years old I have heard voices and I see things no one else does. Imagine being a child and waking up to a 12 foot monster where you can’t move and this happening every single night-imaging the pain fear confusion and agony. Now, imagine having no one to talk to about this or anything else you are going through? 

I have always wanted a girlfriend. I count 47. 47 is the number of girls I have approached and 47 is the number of times It hasn’t worked out. I have never had sex, hung out with, or kissed a girl. They say “don’t compare yourself to other people, the universe works itself out every time” well, it hasn’t, at least not for me.

During my worst psychosis episode I cut myself and put it into pages of the Bible because I was told to do so by an alien in my dreams. I heard a voice say “do it” like it was a real person speaking to me even though I know I was by myself. Fuck it. I grabbed the knife right away. I then decided to use it to open a page of the blood filled bible because I wanted to read something before going out. I said out loud, crying, “god, if you exist please speak to me.” I took a deep breath, waited a few seconds, and opened it. Deuteronomy 22.29. What a joke. 

There is so much more. Some worse, not much better. I wish I could give a testimony about how awesome my life is now or whatever, but that would be a lie. I take Zyprexa, Abilify, and Risperidone for 2 months now. So far no difference. I finally got insurance but put on a huge waitlist for meeting a physiotherapist. I’ll never get my childhood back.

These past two weeks I either don't sleep at all, not even for a second, or I sleep for two hours and wake up with a panic attack. I am exhausted. And I have no time to rest. 
The images from the nightmare stay in my head. I keep having flashbacks, my chest feels so heavy after it and I can't keep my mind off of it the whole day. I can't concetrate. It's like I am awake but mentally I am still trapped in that nightmare.

701,Confessing one thing that absolutely nobody knows about me,"When I was in sixth grade, I was doing absolutely terrible in school. Third year running, but 6th grade was crucial because I had to pass in order to get to Junior High. Without exaggeration or boasting, I was smarter than pretty much everyone in my class. I was merely miserable, every minute of the day, for reasons that are now clear in retrospect. My 6th grade teacher, Mrs. Sue Browne, was a sweet, intelligent woman who finally sat me down for a talking-to, warning me (as gently as she could) that I was in danger of flunking 6th grade and having to repeat it. Her words were gentle and kind, but I took it as another instance of being scolded, same as my mom and my siblings and my other teachers had been doing for years.

  
I think I was supposed to walk away from that conversation with determination to buckle down and do better. It was meant to both threaten me and encourage me. I understood the former but not the latter. 

  
Here, then, is my confession, the one thing I never told anyone. I walked away from that conversation with one thought: If I flunked sixth grade, if I'd got held back while all my classmates advanced, I was going to kill myself. There was no way I could live with that level of humiliation from my peers, or the reprisals from my mom and family. I was only twelve years old and had no idea how one would even go about achieving the goal of suicide, but nevertheless that was the plan, and I'd have figured out how to follow through with it.

  
Not that big a deal, right? a prepubescent harboring suicidal ideation. Here's what I didn't know at the time, my older brother Paul also killed himself at age 13. Hanged himself in our family's bathroom. I knew he died but nobody ever told me he killed himself--I didn't know how he died, since nobody said anything about it I assumed it was an accident or natural causes. I was fully intent on killing myself, by whatever means, without having a clue that my brother had already done exactly that.

707,Struggling to function but don't want to stop trying,"Hi everyone,

I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder about six months ago, but I’ve been struggling with depression my whole life. This past year, however, has been especially tough, and in the last few months, for the first time, I’ve been having trouble functioning daily.

I used to be able to push through, masking all the time and keeping up with responsibilities, but now, it’s getting harder. Going to my full-time office job drains me completely, both mentally and socially. I still go because I feel like if I give in to my depression, it will only pull me down further and I feel like I am not as far gone to label myself as unable to work.

I also attend most social gatherings, birthdays, and family events, especially with my boyfriend’s family. But I’ve noticed that while I can cancel plans with my friends (the people I feel most comfortable around) I'd rather not because they give me some energy, I can’t do the same with my in-laws. These commitments feel non-negotiable, and I constantly feel like I can’t relax or be myself, which makes them incredibly draining.

This weekend is already overwhelming me. On Friday, I have plans with my friends and family, which I’m actually looking forward to but still costs me energy with traveling and not being home. But on Saturday and Sunday, my boyfriend has made plans with his family, and I’m dreading it. I know it will completely drain me, making me emotionally unstable, irritable, and sad. Or maybe just making myself believe that it will be this way is making me worse, I just don't know anymore.

I’ve tried explaining this to my boyfriend, but he doesn’t seem to understand why a packed schedule is bad for my mental health. At the same time, I don’t want to cancel because I fear letting my depression take over or disappointing people or having to explain my situation. 

***So, for those of you who are struggling with depression, how do you balance your schedule? How do you decide what to prioritize without feeling like you're letting people down,or letting yourself down? I’m finding it so hard to set boundaries without feeling guilty.***

Would love to hear your experiences.

I’ve been fighting this battle for so long and I’m about to just give up and end it all. I’ve tried therapy, my last therapist absolutely infuriated me with how cold she was. I told her how openly suicidal I was becoming and she gave me a cup of water and encouraged me to go outside more. I raged at her and never went back. Now I can’t go back to that discount clinic. I’ve had five psychiatrists and over a dozen antidepressants at various dosages. They only made me worse. I was hospitalized twice in my life and both times the psych ward made me feel even more suicidal. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t afford treatment. And even then, I’m not interested in trying it anymore. It’s never helped.

719,I'm constantly miserable and I don't know how to fix it,"Title. Throwaway bc I don't want anyone to recognize me. Sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile. 


I (28F) am extremely burnt out and stuck in a rut and I don't know how to make things better for myself.


I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety when I was 18, though I'm fairly certain that I might be on the spectrum as well.


Currently, I work as a cashier at a fast casual chain. I hate it. I'm extremely good at it, but it sucks the life out of me. I've lost so much empathy to the point where I feel like I'm becoming a horrible person. I genuinely hate the general public. I want to quit, but I don't have any degrees or certifications for anything. I can't go back to college because of financial reasons. I don't care enough about anything to want to make a career out of it. I don't even want a career, period. I tried a desk job once, but I was let go after a month because I wasn't good enough. 


I do a side gig as a thumbnail artist for a Youtuber that I like. I like doing it, and they really like my art. I've been drawing since I was little, and my friends and family think I'm really good at it. I think I'm okay, I guess. I thought about doing art as a job, but I'm not confident in my skills enough for that.


I live with my husband along with my good friend and his girlfriend in a town house. It's a high-income area. None of us make enough to live on our own.


My husband and I want to be parents, but that's not going to happen anytime soon, if at all. We have no money, no space, and no time. We can't even have pets because of our landlord. Despite being a ""great worker"", I only make minimum wage. My doctor has told me that because of my physical and mental health, I shouldn't work more than 6 hours a day and I also need to have at least two consecutive days off to fully rest.


Most days, I get up for work, finish my shift, come home, and try to relax. I have sleep troubles (insomnia, nothing helps) and never feel rested no matter how much sleep I get. My hobbies don't really do anything for me anymore. I never have enough money for anything, since it all goes towards rent and bills. I constantly worry about money. I'm always stressed out. I'm also prone to getting sick often. 


A lot of the time, I wish something would happen to me. I wish I could lose a limb or something, just so I could show other people that ""hey, I'm really NOT okay, stop expecting so much of me"". Often, I just want to die, but it would make other people sad, I guess. 


I'm not smart, I'm not strong, I don't really have any skills, and I don't have any aspirations. The only real thing I have going for me is that I'm likeable, I guess. People like talking to me. I've been told that I'm down to earth, kind, and thoughtful, but I just treat people the way I'd want to be treated. 


I wish I could see a professional to know what's wrong with me, physically and mentally, whatever it is. Is it chronic fatigue? Am I immuno-compromised? Do I have ADHD? Am I autistic? I probably won't ever find out, since I don't have money to take tests like that. I don't care why I feel the way I do, I just want it to stop.


I once spoke to a therapist about my feelings, that I'm tired of surviving and just want to enjoy life. I want to be happy, but I just can't. They told me that some people are just unhappy; and it's no fault of their own, their brains just don't produce the chemicals needed to be happy. I might be one of those. Since then, it's helped me recognize when I'm spiraling into a depressive episode, but not much else.


I feel like I'm just doomed to be unhappy, unhealthy, and poor. I don't know what to do. I feel like it's not fair. ",12,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ison48/im_constantly_miserable_and_i_dont_know_how_to/,EarSquare4818,1739915026.0,depression

729,Tired of feeling like an alien,"I cannot seem to form proper human relationships no matter how much I try. I desperately just want to be able to be around someone who I can be comfortable around and understand. Pretty much my whole life I've had only a few friends, many years I had none, just my cats who have passed away now to keep me company. Everyone just seemed to get bored and forget about me. I was never anyones best friend (not even close), nor did I ever get to be part of a group. I'm 20 now and after some years of total social isolation I have made one friend who I'm somewhat close with but only see occasionally because she lives on the other side of the state and she has many other friends and a boyfriend she is busy with, and 2 acquaintances who I wouldn't likely have if I wasn't always initiating communication. I have tried so hard to make new friends, going to MTG meetups, went to college for 3 yrs always trying to talk with classmates, try to make friends with coworkers at the various jobs I have, nothing sticks and people forget I exist so quickly. I tried asking one person out, he went on one date with me probably out of pity and said he just couldn't feel the same way. I tried online dating, 3 times now I've gone on 1-2 dates with someone before they basically just lose interest completely and barely keep replying. This 3rd time just happened and I'm just so confused and tired. I always ask people so many questions and remember what they say and show genuine interest in everyone, I try to give people thoughtful gifts or draw things for them, I watch/play their show and game recommendations, on dates I pay for any food, drive people around, etc. just generally try to be as friendly and nice as possible. I don't understand why no one ever cares, even a fraction of what I do. I truly try to understand people I talk to, and no one ever tries to understand me. They barely show any interest. I know I am awkward and socially nervous, and I can talk a too much or little sometimes or say strange things, and my interests can be kind of obscure or different than many peoples, but I try my best and I thought it would be enough. 

I mainly have just been filling up my time now. I can slowly feel my passions dying. My favorite thing since I can remember has been drawing, animating, generally being creative. I now illustrate as a side job for a board game company I've been working with the past year. It used to be all I thought about, I was so excited for every work and personal project, but it can be hard to keep myself motivated to complete my deadlines these days. I have two part time jobs, both of which I have been having the hardest time paying attention at. I still get my exercise and eat fairly well and keep up my hygiene, but I've been slipping more and more. My sleep schedule has gotten later and later. I sleep too much. I can't get out of bed until I really have to, I just lay there rotting and wishing I was asleep because everything feels painfully dull to a physically painful degree. My body just feels so heavy all the time. Things I used to be obsessed with that used to bring me so much joy, my favorite shows and games and music and hobbies, feel muted now. Every day I just feel like a little more of me is gone. I'm really trying to focus on what I have. I know my parents love me all though they are hard to talk to sometimes, they are here if I need help and I am very grateful for that. I have food and shelter and water, my health is alright though I have had some issues, and I am happy that the company I work with still wants to commission me, because it's not easy working in illustration. I am really grateful for these things. It's just so hard sometimes lacking human connection so much. When my parents are gone, I think I'll have no one, especially because they are the only family I know. No one to laugh with, share weird facts with, watch shows with, no one to help and no one to help me. I think I'm just going to be alone. And that really sucks, because I want to be with people. Memories feel so much more strong and meaningful with other people. I feel like the biggest joy of life is often sharing experiences and connecting with people, or at least that's how I understand it, and I wish that I could have that too. I don't know why we're here on earth or why we exist, don't think I ever will, but I don't want to be here alone, and I don't have a clue what to do to fix it, or if I can. I don't know anymore. I can only think to keep trying, but I feel hopeless and tired and heavy, and just...like I am always missing something big or doing something terribly wrong, but I can never tell what, I'm just lost.

733,Apology Letter To Younger Self,"I 28(M) was back in my hometown this month and I went to a gym I used to go to when I was 23 and workout a lot at. It is a smaller gym tucked away behind an apartment complex that I am (still) able to sneak into.  I used to imagine how good my life was going to be when I got closer to 30 and now that I am almost there I just wanted to write an apology to my younger self where others could see it. I wanted to say that I am sorry to that young man who was so full of hope and that this version of me was unable to fulfill those dreams he hoped and prayed for. I don't know if anyone can relate to this, but I just felt compelled to write this. I was crying while I was doing my last set on the bench press because I was just thinking I am still in the same place 5 years later. 

 I am sorry that I did not achieve those dreams of starting a business and becoming a 7 figure entrepreneur like you used to wish for, I am sorry I am stuck in a dead end job that barley pays the bills, I am sorry that I have not bought a house yet before 30 and don't see it happening in the near future, I am sorry that you are still single even though you have put yourself out there and I am sorry even though you have been consistent in the gym you still get rejected. I am sorry your social media presence is pretty much non existent. I am sorry I quit that good paying job to pursue my business and it failed. I am sorry I did not invest more into crypto when it was on the rise. I am sorry you lost your happiness and became a bitter person who is upset. I am sorry you wake up everyday for work angry and upset that you are not living a life by your design. I am sorry no matter how hard you try you are just not that attractive. I am sorry your life did not turn out how you planned it and you accomplished 0 of your goals.

When I finished secondary school I was very depressed, I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life, what career I wanted. I ended up going into the first job that accepted me but the career path I choice I have ended up despising. My colleagues all praise me and say how good I am at my job and that I am going to go far. But I have grown to absolutely despise my job. I self sabotage every chance I get and I want nothing more than to quit at this point . 

When I left secondary school I pushed all the friends I had away. For the past 9 years, I have celebrated my birthday and new years alone. For the past nine years I have yo-yo dieted to no end. Reaching my highest of 23 stone was my worst point . I want to have friends but I have gotten to the point of not knowing how to talk to people. I have absolutely no personality, no hobbies which doesn’t help. I don’t know how to connect with people on a deep level. The three people that I have closest to me are all double my age and I constantly push them away. I have never had a boyfriend or even spoken to a boy on that level. I want to be able to give my parents grandchildren. I know how much it means to them, how much they love children but I don’t think that will ever happen.

That is not the real me and I can’t seem to stop doing that anymore… I feel like i’m glaringly out of place, really ugly and creepy and I do everything wrong. I don’t think I am actually any of those things but the feeling is so strong.
I guess has anyone been like this and became normal with friends again?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1it1brc/advice_on_making_friends/,ResidentWorried5649,1739956339.0,depression

741,it's coming back and i'm really scared,"i'm about a month in to a new depressive episode. slowly, i've been sinking deeper and deeper.

i've had many depressive episodes throughout my life, and my last one was almost the end of me. i started seeing a therapist then and am on medication. i've been on medication for two years, and since starting, i have had depressive periods, but they have been nowhere near as severe as the episode i had before starting meds.

i'm still taking my meds, i still occasionally see my psychiatrist and my therapist. but right now is starting to feel like it did before my worst episode ever. that episode lasted a year and i didn't think i'd make it out. i'm terrified. i can't go through that again. i truly don't physically think i can.

i'm already having trouble staying awake throughout the day, finding it hard to eat even though i'm really  *trying *. i love my friends, they are a huge source of happiness in my life, but i'm starting to not be able to enjoy being around them either. it's like i'm constantly bored, like there's this nothingness that can't be filled. i'm trying to keep up with my hobbies, trying to keep a consistent workout routine. but i don't want to do any of it, and i keep feeling worse and worse.

I wasted 5 years of my life. Now I need to go back to high school to get this stupid fucking degree so that I can move on. I need to spend another 4 years in some stupid school that I don't want. Just so that I can get a degree and go to college. 

I wanna study psychology, but that's only a college field. There's no psychology highschool. I feel stuck.

I made racist comments and looking back on it I was turning into a horrible person and our mutual friend had every right to blow up and completely cut off all communication with me. resulting in this my bsf Leah stopped talking to me all together and began to block me on social media and everything overtime.

my everything and i couldn’t believe she was gone.

752,I don’t know if I can ever forgive my parents,"Sorry I rambled for a good while lol, just ignore the ramblings of this depressed insane man, just had to vent I guess lol.

Idk anymore man fuck.

I was always super shy as a kid, had a lot of trouble making new friends. 

So starting high school (year 7 so I was 12), the first fucking day of school, I had legitimately no fucking idea how to get there. It was on the opposite side of the city. 
My dad dropped me off at the bus stop and said take this bus. Luckily other kids got on and I followed them. 
Year 7 was genuinely horrible. I hated that school so fuckijg much, I spent I think every lunch time in the toilet and/or library. I had no friends, I knew a couple people from before so I had acquaintances but no real friends. 
I fucking begged my parents to let me go to this other school where I had a bunch of friends.
They said “no blah blah your school is better”
Year 8 was more of the same, became a bit closer with one of the dudes I knew from before. And made a couple friends, not super close yet but friends I guess.
Then year 9 is probably the last good year I’ve had in my life. Made a couple friends. Found 2 friends who I’m still best friends with now 10 years later… I was genuinely fucking happy, I was happy to go to school for the first time in my life because I had fucking friends.

Then year 10 happened…. And my dad got a job offer in the US (we’re from Australia).
I begged them so fuckijg hard to let me stay with my grandma, but they said “no we don’t have the money for you to stay here alone.” So we moved to America.

And there starts the worst years of my life…. I hated high school in the US with a fucking passion, sorry but everyone is legitimately fucking delusionaly stupid. Like the dumbest kid in Australia (which isn’t even that smart of a country) is like top 10% in the US. That fucking school felt like a fucking prison. No cell signal in most the building, fucking cops walking around with guns, people smoking fucking weed in the toilets…. This was supposed to be one of the best public schools in the city lol.
Also spent every lunchtime in the bathroom/library. From year 10-12 in the US, I made 1 friend, who is a piece of shit who can’t even come out for my bday.
During this time I started smoking cigs, vaping, drinking, various drugs. My sleep schedule was absolutely fucked. I’d sleep from like 7pm-12am and wake up play games with my best friend in Australia for a few hrs then sleep again at like 4am and up for school at 7. Even worse when I got a job, I didn’t change my sleep schedule, just slept like 3hrs a night instead because literally the only good thing in my life was playing pubg with my best friend. 

As soon as high school ended, I moved back to Australia for university. Moved in with my grandparents (who were in much much worse shape at this point than when we left).
Some of my hatred for my parents starts here.
Dad gave me like $500/month to focus on studies and not work (tbh I used it all on drugs lol). It kinda pissed me off that he was giving me money, when 3 years ago, apparently we couldn’t afford that, and 3 years ago I wasn’t even fuckijg asking for money. My grandparents paid all the bills and I worked anyway. There was nothing for my parents to have to pay for. They just didn’t want me leaving them.

I used to argue with my mum all the time that she never listens to me even when I’m right… and she did that for moving to the US.

During uni, I was very addicted to drugs and did some dumb shit. Never really made any connections in Uni cause COVID + I didn’t know people from high school there. So ended up moving back to the US after high school cause my dad got me a super easy job at the company he worked for. 

And now it’s kinda the same as it was in high school here, I fucking hate everything, I have no girlfriend, I have no friends, I do everything fucking alone, I wanna die all the time. 
I wanna move back to Australia, but I don’t think it’ll solve anything. The few good friends I have are either just not good people or they also moved away.

Now I’m stuck feeling like I don’t fit in at all, no matter where the fuck I go. 

I’ve tried so fucking hard since we moved to make friends and shit like that, but I just can’t. I genuinely don’t think I even know how to fucking socialise with people now. I have so god damn much anxiety and my self confidence is loooooooooong gone. I had fucking anxiety for the last 2 days to send someone a fucking thank you text. I have to fucking practice every little thing I say and simulate every possible combination of someone’s reactions to what I’m thinking of saying. I just can’t fucking socially function. 

Logically, I understand why my parents moved us to the US but also, but emotionally I legitimately don’t think I can forgive them for it. Every little bad thing in my life right now is all caused by us moving here, every fucking thing. She’s even apologised, but she doesn’t understand what I’ve been through, she really doesn’t. Honestly looking at her now, all I see is a reminder of the pain she’s caused me. She’s apologised a few times but I just can’t get over this, I really can’t, I really just fucking can’t. I’ve been thinking the last few months how we could be a better family, but I can’t think of any way. I don’t know what to do anymore, I think I’ve genuinely accepted I’m gonna eventually kms. Idk how or when, but it’ll happen. I can’t even fucking imagine being happy anymore, idk how people can be happy, it’s an emotion I just don’t have. 

I just want to fucking feel happiness again. I’m so so tired of this life. Idk how it would even be possible to escape this outside of death. I try so hard, nothing has ever worked.

I get bonds are supposed to be hard work, but to me they feel downright impossible with close to null benefits.

The only relationship I was in I was cheated on. I started trying to go out and talk to more people, but despite a year of this all my relationships are so superficial, as in we only really connect as two lonely people needing any other warm body to talk/ hangout with.

756,Should I keep trusting my therapist?,"My therapist, after 8 months of working together, told me today that my depression is to the point that it requires hospitalization. 
Coincidentally I told her two sessions ago that I wanted to decrease the number of sessions from twice to once per week as I feel so tired of coming every three days and talk about how difficult my thoughts and feelings are. Kind of like I needed a break of so much intense feelings.
I have told her before very difficult thoughts about dying and today we talked about it again. And then after me telling her this, she said that my depression is to the point of having to be interned in a treatment center.
I don’t understand how come after talking about my suicidal thoughts at least 3 times in the last 2 months, she’s now, coincidentally, telling me that my depression is to the state of hospitalization. 
I have told her like a million times that I don’t sleep well, and today she also asked me about which sleeping pills I’m taking (she actually knew the name and mentioned it today without me saying anything) she was very insisting into me checking with the psychiatrist about if I should continue talking this pills, I literally have taken them since before we started sessions together and I told her since the beginning which were the pills, and now today she’s saying that I have to take them every day, that I need to sleep, I have had insomnia for months and she knows it and today she decided to tell me that I have to take the pills everyday or talk to the psychiatrist.
I don’t want to think negatively about her, but feels suspicious that she’s pushing so much for me not to cut the number of sessions to once per week. 
I’m aware I have trust issues, and I grew up with my parents telling me that psychologists are bad, manipulative, etc so Im a bit biased towards doubting them, although I have been in therapy the last 10 years.

Two months ago I lost a good friend to suicide, no one really checked up on me. I came to the realization that I'm always helping others mentally but no one really helps me. My closest friend lives 9hrs away and we used to play video games almost everyday for years until now. And the other one is my older brother who I honestly trust more, he lives with me and has had depression for more than half of his life.

And even when I was at my lowest I still checked up on him and was there if he needed me. I'm 100% sure I can talk to him because he is a good listener but I dont feel comfortable talking to him about this. I could approach him but I want him to approach me.

759,Just A Letter Because I Miss Feeling Loved...,"I know you're out there. Searching, looking, thinking about finding a girl who gives you the world. We're taken for granted, judged, rejected, unwanted. I know my worth and I hope that maybe one person out there will read this and see it, wanting to claim it for their own.

You're an older, heavier man with charm, charisma and wisdom. Your sense of humor is immeasurable. You're honest, truthful, loyal. You're fun, brave and loving. You know I'm the one you want to see walking down the aisle for you. You're mature. You're the most attractive creature I've ever laid eyes on. You accept me as me, as who I am, faults and all. You accept me for every scar, for every inch of flesh and fiber of my being and I do so for you. To you, I am perfect and to me, I wouldn't have you any other way. 

We focus mostly on each other - small friend groups but big hearts. I care a lot. I like giving gifts. Tell me your favorite hobby, your favorite game, your favorite candy and it could just be a surprise without a special occasion. I want to buy you the world on a silver platter only if you do the same for me.

I want our intimacy to be golden. I can read a milligram of a shift in mood. I want to turn you on, please you, lovingly, softly. I want to give you that intimate feeling without touching you. I want to light your skin ablaze every time my fingertips graze your flesh. I want to be able to trace every inch of your body and kiss it. 

I want to take care of you. I'm the type to pick up on the small things you do, the things you didn't know you needed handed to you without you asking. Being woken up with a kiss on the cheek or my face, planted into your back and giving it kisses. Sleeping next to you will be one of my favorite pastimes. I want to remember every inch of your naked flesh. I want to remember the curves and crevices. I want to kiss your soft, thin lips and smile, running my fingers through your hair happily. I want to think about your scent, attaching itself to me; letting me smell you, inhale you, enjoy every second of you. I'll get up, and cook you a warm breakfast: your favorite of pancakes with sausage and eggs. I scramble them just as you like, with a bit of cheese and serve them with a smile. 

I want our days off together to be magical. We watch movies, play games, talk, enjoy each other's company. I want to meal prep for your long days at work and even make you soft, delicate meals for when you're home. I want to bring you happiness in ways you never thought of. I want to do the small things - cleaning your electric razor, giving you your favorite comfort food when you're hurt, making sure to bring you lunch if you've forgotten it. I want to write you love notes and poetry and songs and goof around on your piano or whatever instrument you have. I want to share sweet drinks with you and sing songs in your car as we make our way to our destination. I want you to remember special dates we have, the meals, the laughs. I want to partake in your hobbies. I want to help you paint your miniatures and watch anime and laugh. I want to discuss deep things. I want to be your biggest supporter. I want you to never forget how loved you are.

I need someone who matches this energy. Who craves to be loved and won't take me for granted. I don't want to waste my time for someone who doesn't know what they want. I don't want to spend days begging for attention and affection. I don't want to have to ask for the things I do in return. I want that. I want the cheesy poems and love notes and the remembering and treasuring special times and dates. I want to wake up and see a good morning text and know that you love me. I want the jokes and playful demeanor that comes with love. I want a child-like whimsy. Someone who knows how to joke and be serious when need be. I need someone willing to put me first, to truly love me, to make me feel safe. I want to be able to be myself, to be open and loving and to be able to cherish the person I'm with. I want to know that you've made the right choice - I want to feel like your right person and not just second fiddle to your ex. I want to be touched, to be held. I want to be craved like a meal on a starving stomach. I want to know we're making love. I want us to be able to devour each other's love. I want you to know how lucky you are to have me, how rare I am, how special I am and I don't want you to give that up. Be selfish, crave it, sink your teeth into it. Make it yours, permanently. Realize what you have and treasure it. You won't find someone like me again. I want you to be my person. And I want to be yours. 

I want to marry the love in my stories, in my poems, a man who knows just how fortunate he is to have me and never wants to let go.

760,Anhedonia but doing all the things,"I'm doing all the things.

Exercise, good diet, keeping animals, ended a bad relationship. I'm working on moving out. Every single home I try to put a deposit on gets scooped up. I'm essentially stuck where I am, every week a game of what house will I not be able to get. Journaling, attending cptsd meetings, on and on. Endless stream of useless shit to-do's.

I've been unable to enjoy anything for half a year or so off and on, now I just don't enjoy anything. I'm tired of going to one useless therapist after another (8 so far). I have tried forcing myself to do hobbies and I'm so tired of forcing myself to do them so I've stopped. No enjoyment, it feels like work. I just don't feel like doing anything and when I force myself to do all the things I need to do, its just work. Day in and day out work.

761,-100 Care to Give. I'm so over dealing with people and life.,"I'm utterly beyond exhausted. I'm older than most of you (42 - still can't believe I made it this far.) I've been dealing with depression for my entire life; I've had stages where I was able to manage it a lot better than others, but in the past 4-5 years I just seriously can't muster an ounce of care anymore. 

I'm struggling with work because my depression & ADHD are making it impossible, and once again, my team dislikes me. 

I'm about to lose my job because my team won't communicate with me about what tasks are coming up or due. They list all of them on Asana, but my ADHD brain sometimes accidentally marks one as ""complete"" when it isn't, or I just miss something. They are never like ""Hey, here's this lists of projects we need your help with this quarter,"" or ""Hey, the due date for this may change, so don't forget to check on it.""  My brain can't keep track of it from an Asana board.  I keep asking for them to fill out the master list of projects so I know what BIG projects are happening, so if I miss my task for that project, I'm aware ""hmm, I checked off all 6 other projects this month, but I know they said there were 7, so I'm missing one."" NOPE, instead, I get written up today because they didn't even properly TAG me in the Asana task, but guess who's fault it is?  Mine.  ☠️   Don't communicate with me, don't do ANYTHING to help, just blame ME when shit happens.  The worst fucking part is that it took me all of 10 minutes to fix it, and then I've been sitting being lectured by my boss about it for the last 2 hours.  🤮😭

This is just one example of the constant, constant, constant dealing with people, and I just can't anymore.  Even if/when I lose this job, I am NOT going to bother looking for another one, why bother?  Fill out 3,000 applications, get 2 interviews and NO job offers?!?!?!   I'M SICK OF IT!!!

I desperately need an idea of a business to start because I seriously can not continually keep answering to bosses who do write-ups and evaluations and give me a bad review for shit that can all literally be fixed in 10 minutes or less.  

I can not tolerate having to deal with human beings anymore.  I don't know how I'm supposed to keep doing it. I have -100 fucks to give about anything having to do with people.

768,i’ve reached the end of the road,"It’s not so much that I want to die (although I do) but that there is nothing left to live—there is no life that stretches before me. It might have once existed; as a teenager I was living on borrowed time, but I didn’t manage to steal it, to make it my own—and now I’m here. I suppose at some point down the line I could have reversed it. But I didn’t. 

When I was a kid I thought I was going to grow up and be happy, become a real person. I’ve never been less of a person now, less real. I feel like a shadow. There is nothing inside of me. I close the curtains on my windows because I can’t stand looking outside at a world I can’t partake in. It’s like I’m constitutionally unfit to be here.

I don’t know why I’m writing this. It’s not my suicide note; I haven’t yet decided how and when I’m going to kill myself, and I still have my mom to think about.

769,My parents guilted me for wanting to die,"I 15f have been depressed for 2 years. I reluctantly told my parents I'm depressed 1.5 years ago and i regret telling them. 

They don't understand somehow, I don't get how they dont as they have both been depressed before but.. My mom doesn't understand how hard it is for me to do simple things, she just thinks im lazy, she doesn't get how much energy it takes for me to go wash my hair, do the dishes, eat a proper meal, clean my room, etc. Every now and then when im having an especially bad day I can't hold myself from crying in front of them. It always ends up worse that before though. My dad doesn't know how to listen without telling me how good i have it and how other people in the world dont. But my mom is blunt and has told me to stop complaining or she tells me what to do and when i tell her i just want her to listen and not give me suggestions she doesnt take it well. 

a month ago i was telling her (crying too) about how i hate high school and don't really like/ relate to my friends she told me that i need to invite my friends around more (dumb suggestion if i just told u i dont like them) and told me to stop complaining if i wasnt gonna do that. i didnt want to talk to her after that. 

A couple months ago i was having one of those cry sessions and accidentaly said i dont want to be here anymore so my mom took me to a nurse the next day (the one good thing shes done) and it was good i liked the nurse and saw her 2 more times but i wasnt allowed to see her again and had to go to another person as she wasnt a proper therapist. 3 people later i didnt like the third person, saw her twice but decided i didnt want to tell my life story to her. Told my mom that on the way back and she didnt respect my decision, told my dad and he came in to try and talk me into going back to her and asked me why i dont open up more. So, I did. I told him ""I just want to die"" and he reacted really bad, im not planning anything but if i was i think that wouldve pushed me over the edge. He said ""Why would you say that to someone who's sister did that and to a guy whos father is terminal and would kill to live your life"" that made me really mad because I feel like he made me feel guilty for feeling the way i feel after he had just told me to open up more. this was like a week ago and i still havent forgiven him. he apologised reluctantly straight after when i was angry at him but idk i still dont want to talk to him. 

Now my parents are all in my business. I was gonna book a appointment with the school counsellor and did today but on the car ride home my mom got angry with me when i didnt want to talk to her about booking an appointment and tbh i blocked it out but i remember it made me feel shit.

770,I don’t rlly know what to do to help myself through this,"For context I’m a teen. I’m not gonna say my exact age for privacy but I experienced really heavy grief when I was younger from the loss of a parent that was my favorite person and this grief has caused me a lot of mental health troubles including trauma, anxiety, possible ptsd, suicidal thoughts, and more. I developed depression after my favorite person passed (I think I might’ve had before then but I can’t say for sure) and I’m one that doesn’t talk that openly to people I know (including my family) about my struggles because in the past I’ve have many experiences with people feeding me their own thoughts or opinions on what I’m experiencing and aren’t very open to being a good listener. I’ve had more bad reactions than good so I keep to myself A lot to protect my peace. Close to before my parent passed away I had a random thought. I way younger at the time (Younger than 13) and hadn’t experienced grief or the death of a loved one before this. I told myself that if my parent died I would end my life. I thought this because I didn’t think I’d be able to live without them because they were my whole world. It felt like a promise to me and I’m convinced that my dissociation that started two years after my parent passed saved me. I’ve had many thoughts about suicide since that one time but it wasn’t serious. It was passive suicidal thoughts. I knew I didn’t have an intent on acting on them nor did I have a plan and I couldn’t see myself actually going through with it at all. Until after years it got really bad last year (meaning 2024) and I would have period of time where mg mind would try and convince myself to just go and do it. It escalated from intrusive thoughts to more of active suicidal ideation. I tried to convince myself to stay with telling myself “Stay till that concert you got tickets for” or “Stay until Christmas” ect. I was thinking ent suicide everyday and was really depressed a few months ago leading up to December. On the 27th of December I started writing letters on my phone and convinced myself that I was going to end it. It’s not that I actually want to. Like most people I to just don’t know how to work through a lot of my pain and mental health struggles especially since I’m terrified of reaching out for help. I was talking to this guy at the time (we dated in the summer and I broke things off and we started talking again in September and were in a situationship in December and I could see myself being happy with this guy like I was before) that night on the 27th I thought about how I was so excited to be able to be with him again and I didn’t wanna leave him again right before we would be able to experience what we didn’t get to in the summer. I felt guilty for possibly leaving him suddenly like that so I decided to text him. It was like 1am and he isn’t often up at that time if we weren’t texting. So I texted him, he replied, and I took it as a sign. I told myself that if things didn’t work out between us then I’d go through with my plan. Like it’s a last resort to feel okay and make myself stay. Out relationship was good and toxic at the same time. I felt happy during our relationship and that was the first time I felt happy in a longggggg time without sadness clouding it.
He started acting distant in the past few weeks and after awhile of trying to communicate the issues and not being treated right I had to end the relationship once again. About a week before I broke up with him (I broke up with him a week ago, the Tuesday before Valentine’s Day) I started noticing that I thought I was development feelings for my friend (she’s a girl, I’m bi) and after I finally broke up with my bf after the relationship falling apart for weeks I started feeling stronger feeling for her. I feel safe and comfortable being myself around her which I don’t feel for other people and it felt pretty obvious that I do like her. Well the feelings started turning into Limerence quickly and I got anxious because I sometimes get attached to people obsessively. It happened with my bf and now her. My suicidal thoughts were basically gone and my depression hasn’t been giving me any trouble since me and my bf got together. Well I realized that I think I’m trying to rely on this girl to save me too so I don’t choose to end it. I know it’s not healthy and now that I realize it I’m working to figure out a solution because it’s not healthy for me and it’s not okay for me to drag her down with me just because of my mental health issues. Btw this girl definitely likes me and I’ve knows since December so that makes me feel even more guilty for feeling Limerence because I don’t want to lead her on or break her heart. The thing that I don’t know what to do about it how I don’t know how to cope with my depression and suicidal thoughts anymore. Now that I’ve realized the way I’ve been trying to cope and I’ve let myself feel those feelings I don’t know how I can not get back to where I was in December. Though I didn’t think I could bring myself to actually do it I felt very close to going through with it at the same time. I‘ve been isolating from most of my family recently and I feel detached and like I don’t connect with those around me to be able to tell about my struggles. I’m scared to tell my therapist because the therapy place I go to doesn’t seem to play around when it comes to suicidal thoughts or self harm or any of that so I know that even if I said that I just have had passive thoughts they would still have to alert my parent to let them know even if I’m not a danger to myself.

779,Brother is a narcissist,"My brother is a narcissist


I (37M) have a younger brother (31) who has been acting strangely for at least 15 years. I’ve always loved him a lot, so I put up with it, played the role of the older brother, helped him, solved his problems, and listened to him for endless hours.

I’ve been in therapy for a few years, worked through my mild depression, and completely turned my life around. Since therapy had such a positive effect on me, I suggested that my brother try it too, since he was struggling—but I never really knew what exactly was wrong.

There’s way too much to unpack, so I’ll summarize: He’s extremely jealous of me, always tries to one-up me, manipulates my decisions to his advantage, and even pressures me to avoid certain places because he feels overshadowed by me. On the surface, he’s polite, but every conversation is laced with subtle jabs meant to belittle my life, experiences, and choices. He has never invited me to his birthday, while I always invite him to mine. He once told me that he knows I love him, but he isn’t sure if he does. Then at my wedding he says in front of everyone he always wanted to be like me and I’m his idol. He blames me for “ruining his teenage years” because I used to argue with our parents. He’s also straight-up told me he sometimes gets flashes of wanting to kill me.

Years ago, I had a one-time thing with one of his friends (not a girlfriend or anything), and to this day, he still brings it up to shame me. He says cruel things like it’s nothing, as if I have no feelings, while I’ve spent the last 15 years walking on eggshells, terrified of losing him.

Six months ago, we had a massive fight after a night out at a bar. I was about to leave to avoid drama, but he insisted I stay. When I did, and I dared to speak to his friends, he completely lost it on me. That moment changed everything—I started seeing him for who he really is, and since then, my resentment has only grown.

By chance, I recently found out that he was diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, with borderline traits and something else the person refused to disclose, saying, “If I tell you, you’ll look it up and freak out.” Well, I’m already freaked out. And honestly, I can’t stand him anymore.

He treats me like he gets to decide when I exist in his life and when I don’t. He disappears for months, then acts like it’s my fault and says I “know what I did.” I don’t want to play along anymore. I wrote him a letter, but I don’t have the courage to give it to him. Maybe I’ll add it to this post later.

My therapist will definitely help me navigate this, but I’m posting here because I’d really like to hear from people who’ve dealt with something similar.

Looking to corrupt one or both partners, to get what they want from it, or to bring someone to their level IE be single be a hoe because I am too type stuff. Make someone look bad so they can shoot their shot. 
We slave away in factories and 12 hour shifts and have the things people consider to be hobbies the things that pull us away from the dreary work life replaced by AI instead of our work. We are being lied to by pharmaceutical and political parties, and drained dry as the lower class preyed upon unable to stand up without getting beaten back down. Women looking to be with the top percentage of earners while actively draining the funds of the man who is trying to provide instead of providing their share. Marriage a contract where you’re held by the balls and cucked when they cheat and take all of your stuff and kids with them. What is the point to this world of suffering , this world , its people, absolutely disgust me.  I can’t say the words because I won’t let myself but I sympathize with those who do , or who leave. Love and respect do not truly exist they’re superficial simulacrums of what they used to be , sex shoved in our face further in our aging infidelity and those seeking to push someone to commit those acts. People cheating on you even, then proceeding to act faithful to others. This world is full of scumbags and the good efforts from others are trampled. There’s not really a point anymore, I wish this whole world of man, was wiped away from existence, just nature alone again. At least that was raw. Ugly yet beautiful. Nothing has interest anymore , I have to question people’s two faced narcissistic tendencies they are aware of yet refuse to change, I’m forced to be strong and stay in a world I just wish to not have to have ptsd or trauma, to be in anymore. It’s not that I don’t want to exist , but I don’t want this world in its current state , its current form to.  I try to do good , love unconditionally and through the bad , in all its forms , walking in love. But I can’t love myself enough to walk away from this world. A world I’m forced to participate in. I regret being born for the sickness I was immediately faced with being raped and emasculated when I was just a child and it effecting all of my subsequent relationships, my family , and my friendships. I say all this to ask : does anyone else feel or think the way I do about these things ? I get the whole I’m not alone shtick but even if I’m not I can’t wrap my head around why I would ever want to be in such an evil world. Why others are so afraid to be good people. If then to call their evil good. It’s easier to sin and be happy than it is to do well and struggle. But I’m sick of struggling with no end in sight. There’s no end in sight. I pray while my mind eats me alive trying to find a way out. I need to change as much as the world does , but I don’t want to bend my character to fit into a world as despicable as this one. I’m sick of others , I want to hole up like an agoraphobic yet the cabin fever makes it all so much worse. I need advice , not sympathy. I have good emotional intelligence in some sense rationality displayed person to person , but the mind when it’s by itself is neither of those things. It’s easier to find that common connection talking with someone and to find the rational responses and answers when you have someone to talk to. But I can’t go to a therapist, been there done that, I’ve read some of the threads here, and I guess just looking to share my internal perspective and outlook I don’t share with anybody around me.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1isxhjz/the_state_of_us/,DDDHighGustAlexander,1739941082.0,depression

787,I JUST DON'T WANNA BE ALONE,"I'm having a bad night.
I posted this somewhere else but it got taken down, I don't know why I'm trying again.

All I am thinking are basically the words repeated ""I can't"".

I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't, over and over.

I need help, I need help to get help. I want to whant the help, and be a productive member of society.

Trauma: Alcoholic Mom, unbalanced family dynamic, Sibling with Personality Disorders, exposed to porn too yong, abusive ""friends"",siblings going to inpatient... suicide attempts, clams of rape, I wasn't allowed to walk at graduation.

I berly made it out of school. I had an IEP and was told I had a ""unspecified reading disability"". Thanks for fuck'n nothing.

I had teachers call me a liaer. They also made me feel stupid as fuck. I loved learning. I hated school.

I did lie a lot.. but not for the reason all my teachers and parents thought. I almost never did homework, and played games to drown out my home life and the memories.

I never liked lieing but I didn't know what to do. I felt trapped in school. There was no way the real reason I struggle was a good enough excuse for my actions.

Well, I tried. Or broke. I was crying, because my mom had relapsed and driven me home drunk the day befor. I was sent out of class and I told the truth.

We did the hole CPS thing. Got a case, blah, blah. But the thing that broke me is, me at about 11 or 12 says something like,

Are you sure you should be driving... did you take something.

She lied and said it was a med.

I asked her if she should have been driving on it, and she was out of it.

I told her to tell the truth and she started speeding and crying...

I just remembered telling her I couldn't forgive her for putting us in that kinda danger.

This is just one memory. I've seen her on the bathroom floor, I remember her smelling like it, and I remember to much.

She doesn't remember any of it.

She did ECT as another alternative to medicine for her depression, and is now suffering memory loss.

I can't tell her any of that, I wanna forget, because there are somethings I can't forgive. You are sober when you pick up the bottle.

One of my siblings had a personality disorder. Hallucinations and all. I don't know when it started, but I remembered all of the different kinda of things she would tell us we did, That happened, That is happening, There are bugs, there's someone, you guys are trying to poison me, he raped me...

That one lead to our Mom being called a lier in court.

I have no possible comprehension of what she could have expected. But I do know what I did.

She walked in to our rooms at night. Punch and kicked my mom when she took her to the doctor.

My mental health has been affected by this but I can't say that.

Anyway, I'm just typing to vent, but I'm just feeling like I don't have a chance right now.

I'm trying to start working with professionals, but I can't seem to even do that.

I feel like I'm about to let everyone down if I haven't already.

My brother is a fucking nurse, And the other wants to be a therapist.

What in the fuck am I gonna do... No one needs to answer.

I've never been suicidal, or wanted to self harm so don't worry about that.

I've just fallen in to a depression. If anything does happen to me it is purely from my lack of motivation. I guess it is possible, but I'm trying not to care.

Life fucking sucks. The second anything seems to look like it's going good I'll get thrown a curve ball. Could be anything from my mom and dad getting divorced to my friends dad dying and him being paralyzed in a car accident. And I'm just getting started. Life has nothing but pain as you get older. I'm lonely, tired, depressed, and ready to just fucking end my shitty life. Fuck humanity, bunch of worthless, selfish assholes and retards that can’t do shit and get mad at each other for it. The school system does nothing but kill kids and turn their corpses into workers for the government. I'm sick and tired of the constant unrest, can't even escape it in my own damn room. The constant arguing and fighting. Never a moment of peace. Never a second of true rest. I will forever be lonely, even if I find someone to love me life will find a way to fuck it up. I get sick right before the end of the swim season and now there aren’t any more practices so I’m left with all this goddam energy and nothing to do with it while my moms getting mad at me and my sister and my sister is actually just doing nothing all day demanding she get waited on by my mom and I’m sick of it. And all this is happening while we barely have the money to eat. I would just kill myself, I live right on a highway, but I can't cause that wouldn't be fair to those around me. It'd do more harm to them than to myself. I wish I could just fucking nuke the earth then shoot myself. 
But of course I won't even be able to commit suicide cause I'm so damn attached to the people I love, the people I want to kill the most so they can know peace. I'd rather them be dead and live with the grief than dye knowing I'd caused them pain. Fuck life. Fuck the system. Fuck humanity.

I'm stirring the beans and suddenly my brain said...
""You could disappear. You're smart enough.""

It rocked me back visibly. They looked over to see if I'm okay. It took my breath away. Like I could have just fell to the floor and cried until I was no longer breathing. 
I faked a sneeze and then the wheels started spinning. Silently, I stood there and just completely deadened my aura to the room. 

""Why not?"" It said.

""What's the point of all this. You work a low income job as a body. They'll just find another. If you go missing first. Your mom will assume you just ran away like you did before. No one would ever even think you were dead. Just...off doing drugs. Relapsed. Found a new boy. They wouldn't think twice that you may be rotting in a Redwood forest.... I bet it's quiet there...""

Because I've put so much effort into guilting myself out of that picture.
""But you would be missing. You'd hurt everyone like that? Seriously? Jesus Christ, Duckie. 
No. You owe it to them. You promised you'd never hurt your mom like that again. You will not rob yourself from your family. Get a grip.""

I realize I'm not breathing and zoned out stirring weirdly and way too much.
So I sit down the spoon and her picture wins. But the forest echoes in my head. 
I don't want to be here. I want to be somewhere quiet. Where I don't bother anyone anymore. I don't break things. I'm not annoying.

I look to the rest of the room. I breathe deeply and ""turn my aura back on.""
It's like a software my brain can run.

807,I feel like everything is falling apart,"I have been depressed for a long time. I started a new job a little less than a year ago (in sales), and nothing that I am doing has been effective. I've spoken to past mentors, managers, other team members, and they said I am doing all the right things, but no matter what, I am not getting sales, meetings, or even conversations with prospects.

On top of this, I take on a majority of the responsibilities at home. We got a dog back in July (that I wasn't thrilled about, but I was overruled), and I am up early with her, go to bed late to take her out. My partner suffers from chronic migraines and an autoimmune disease, so a lot of the house responsibilities fall on me.

We have 2 kids, 5 and 1. I delay my the start of my workday to get my oldest to the bus, take a break in the afternoon to get them off the bus, and also end my day early 2-3 days per week to take them to their after school activities. 

I feel like I am failing at everything and can't balance it all. I'm stressed out about home life making sure I'm a good dad, stressed out about work because I feel like a failure, stressed out because I want to get healthy but don't have the time, and stressed out because I want to have a social life but my responsibilities won't let me.

I want to get help, professionally, but I am stressed out about spending the money for that. I would not say I am suicidal, but on my way home tonight from one of the very few social events I am able to get to, I fantasized about just running the car off the road, and what would happen. I would not do anything to harm myself, because my kids don't deserve something like that, but the thought is there.

I'm worried I'm going to lose my job because I'm not producing, no matter how much I try. I'm stressed about giving my kids the life they deserve. I'm stressed about giving my partner the life she deserves. It has all been coming to a tipping point lately, most likely because of the work stress.

I don't even know why I'm writing this out. I guess just to yell into the internet void and hoping I get some reassuring words, but who knows.

808,yay depression,"im writing this at midnight, im a kid who its life is just falling apart and i dont want to live anymore (this weekend i will hang out with my friends for the last time)

since i was in elementary school, i did birthdays with a large group of ""friends"", but those friends always ignored me and played with their phones togheter while i didn't had a phone

i remember when my parents bought me an iphone 5 to make friends in my classroom but they never wanted to stay with me

skipping to middle school, i was always alone and on a random day i found out my class hanged out togheter but without me

i actually did friends the last year of middle school, 2 exactly, but one of them forced me to stay with him and do what he said, and the other one was actually a good friend, but i was too stupid and for a STUPID discussion i ruined her life (i have no way to ask her sorry)

skipping to high school, some of my classmates talk go me and i fell in love with a girl from another school but she actually love me too.

however i only can see her once a month and students older than me joke about me and some professors hate me but is only because my cousins are troublemakers at school. (i have very bad grades)

i can't do much to be honest, i want to be better but say it everyday and i always fall so deep

my dad is working hard for me for a way to make me stay with my friends, but i don't how to tell him i have no friends to stay with

my sister also hate me, she now has 13 years and is always with her friends while she tries to avoid me as much as possible

i know, probably your thinking ""this kid did something wrong and f@cked up his life"" but no. my family is well known for being bad people but i dont want to

i have a passion actually, i like computers and i want to become a game developer but those last months im learning nothing and im staying at my home everyday.

i watch alot of films everyday with my dad, the last one i watched (and my new favorite one) is ""The gorge"", i love the action but mostly the main characters, they love eachother and that made me happy for a after a very long time in a while, but this is just fiction, of course

im not asking for help, there is nothing left for me. i genuinely hate how my parents will feel after doing all this for me and find their son dead. i was thinking of doing it for years but i will finally do it one day or another, the world hates me but i don't

810,i almost did it after 3 years of no attempts,"I was so damn close to doing it

My life has been turning to shit. I broke my 3 year no SH streak yesterday after a big argument with my girlfriend. I used to be insanely depressed and suicidal a few years ago and things had gotten a lot better but recently everythings just coming back. I have so much to do for school yet zero motivation to do it. I dont sleep, i dont eat, and i’ve stopped hanging out with people as much, my life just isent moving forward. 

And then of course I get feelings for someone else and my girlfriend finds out I kissed her once and freaks out on me (which is understandable) and says how absolutely disgusted she is and how im a horrible human being and how she just cannot even understand why I did that and to be honest, i dont either. I dont have answers for anything. I think me and her are breaking up though. I dont blame her whatsoever but all this has done is reaffirmed my self hatred. Ive been keeping it down and i just cant anymore and all those feelings are flooding back in. Me and her have been dating for 3 months and she said I love you within 2 weeks which scared the fuck out of me and it just set me off for 3 months of being unsure while she fell more and more for me. I was just scared of telling her anything. 

After she was done yelling at me, she drove off to work and I ended up driving to a high bridge I know. I walked over to the anti suicide fence and just stared for 30 minutes thinking. I wanted to just do it and be over with it so fast, it would have been so easy. Some people would walk by but no one even looked me in the eye. I dont know, im just losing it. I know im a bad person wnd want to be dead, its just damn hard to actually make myself try again (Ive had 7 actual attempts).

I feel so lost these days, I wake up and immediately start crying. I struggle to keep any job down. I think I could find happiness working in the film industry but it’s so hard to get a job you need experience even for the entry level ones. Basically I’m wondering if it would be a disservice to a child bringing them into a life with such a depressed mother. I’m not always waking up crying but I can’t say I’ll never have a bad period like this again. Maybe it’s unreasonable even to put a spouse through this.

Recently I've been struggling with a severe case of depression. My anxiety had improved on the diet lately but have this overwhelming sadness that I can't otherwise explain except for the change in diet.

814,I'm getting worse.,"Please bear with me because this will probably just be the ramblings of a fool. Whoever decides to listen, thanks.

I'm getting worse every day. I haven't eaten anything today except a bowl of cereal for breakfast and three pieces of Hawaiian rolls. I want to kill myself but I can't. I hate that I'm privileged and that I feel so depressed every day. I have 2 people that I consider friends but don't see that much. I hate this. I've been to the mental hospital 4 times in 2024 in the span of 3-ish months. I can't do this. I'm in school and I don't even know what I'm doing. I hate that my parents love me and I know that's a wrong thing to say. I wish they didn't love me so I would have an excuse to resent them. I remember being called disrespectful, being told I talk too much, I talk back too much, told to be quiet, and such as a kid. I don't remember anything good from my life. I'm 18 and I barely remember anything before the age of 13. I'm depressed, anxious, and autistic. Being autistic has caused so many dumb issues. I'm beginning to just become completely quiet and only speaking when necessary. I'm so mad and numb at the same time. I want this all to go away. I wish I could give my life to someone who wants it. I've started smoking weed and it helps slightly. Yes, I know it's ""not acceptable"", spare me the shit. It's the only thing that works so far. Meds don't work, I've tried about 6 types. I can't sleep without taking stupid Seroquel. I'm so tired, man. I want to give up so badly. I just want help. I feel like such a burden on my family. I hate having sessions, meds, and tearing this family apart by being the ""mentally ill"" child. I want to scream and punch things. Why do I have to be like this? I want to run away and never come back. I'm a worthless, jobless, lonely loser that deserves to die but can't even bring himself to do so. I wish I could live in a mental hospital for the rest of my days and never come back. I'm a piece of shit that needs to go away forever. I want to smoke my problems away but I don't even own any, I have to rely on a friend to do so. I feel like I'm a fool. I'm sad, angry, and hurt. I wish I didn't have this life.

821,I don’t know what to do anymore,"1. I hate reaching out to people, and unfortunately, even online, they seem to be annoyed or carry the weight of my issues on them when I try to let it out and talk about it. I've tried school mental health counselors but it doesn't seem like they actually care. They just want me to finish crying and leave. It's like I'm talking to a robot, always trying to find solutions. There is no solution. 

2. I was a straight A student and I can barely keep my As and I have to fight so hard and by the semester to only settle for a certain grade because I apparently did study hard enough, didn't work hard enough, didn't understand the concepts enough. Yes, I am an AP student. But why don't I know anyone who struggles as much as I do? Yes, I got a competitive and small public high school. I can't help but compare myself. 

3. I do a bunch of shit outside of school ALL so I can kiss the feet of these prestigious and expensive institutions and beg them to let me in because what? I served my community? I had this passion that I will continue to apply once I am in college? And the sad thing is, this is exactly what I want. I want to be accepted and I want to continue in an environment that challenges me because I know that if I'm not in one, I will feel like a waste. The effort I put in from the ages 13 to 17, they would mean nothing. My childhood being thrown away. I don't recall being happy for more than a single day unless I'm hanging out with my friends for a few hours and putting all my worries behind me for a certain amount of time. 

4. I just want to be respected. I'm the definition of mediocre, no one sees me or hears my name and is like ""wow she's really special or she's really smart."" I try so hard and work so hard but I never get the results. And all i do is just cry and wither in self pity that I can't afford. And I hate my self for pitying myself so it's just this never ending cycle of me being my own biggest enemy. 

It really just hurts so much and I feel nauseous all the time and I can sleep properly unless I have something to distract me, but once that's put away, and productivity begin, the emotions flood back in. I hate feeling this way and I hate being human. Everything is important and none of it I can do without wanting to utterly end my life.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1isus51/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,Medical_Zucchini739,1739932612.0,depression

I don’t think I’m that unlikeable but I guess I am. I knew this college was competitive socially, but I honestly did not expect it to be this bad.

836,Will Things Ever Get Better?,"Hey guys

This is a throw away account

I'm 28F and moved to a new country a couple of years ago.

I already have a undergrad degree, but I am currently trying to get into a second entry program to get credentials here. I spent most of my 20s depressed and have been through a lot, to say the least. I am diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, mostly managed by medication. I always get help, therapy, I always reach out. But now, I am so tired.

I am at a point in my life where things feel like they will never get better. I have recently been through a lot of trauma, had to come back and complete college applications (for second entry programs) while studying for my pre-requisites at a university full-time. 

My first semester of pre-requisites were hard (due to life circumstances) but I felt interested in what I was studying. Now I'm a month behind, super depressed and have such a busy schedule ahead. What I study irritates me. It's hard to focus and I constantly feel like crying. I can't take a break or drop out, I know I'm burnt out and depressed, however I've already taken a 3 year break to get better and move here, I don't want to take more time off.

Each time I get this depressed, I feel like the only way out is the unspeakable. Of course, I don't want that. That is why I am here, but I honestly don't feel like things will ever get better. I can't remember a time in my life where I spent an entire week happy. 

I don't want to do school work, or house work. Nothing brings me joy and I just want to cry. I am looking for some hope, for someone, that it indeed does get better, and life won't be shitty forever.

Thank you

837,What's even the point of keeping myself alive?,I can't seem to find a reason to keep living. Almost everyone is gone and those that remain don't have the time to talk for even just a few minutes. It's probably all my fault I tend to make people uncomfortable or ruin everything from catching feelings that don't exsist. I've never had a basis for telling what love is so whenever someone shows up I can't ever tell if it's platonic and I'm just traumatized or if it's a crush.

839,Reasons for Living,"l've been trying to think of things that make me want to live, and I've been coming up empty handed. Does anyone here actually want to live?
And if so, why? I seem to be able to find reasons to not die (such as emotionally scarring my friends and family), but I can't find things that I actually enjoy and want to keep living for. For example, I can recognize that I like listening to music or playing video games; however, it does not make me want to live. I find that things can be enjoyable but are ultimately means of putting off death. Like I'm procrastinating dying by listening to music and playing games (if that makes sense at all).

I was standing by the doors and moved aside to give him and his 2 dogs space. The dogs start behaving badly and he proceeds to discipline them in a borderline abusive way that I won’t go into detail on but scrapes my thigh and hurts me fairly bad where it stings in the process. 

I politely say excuse me to let him know he’s hurt me so that he doesn’t hurt anyone else if he proceeds to repeat his actions on a tube / train but instead of listening to what I’m saying he automatically assumes I’m talking about how he disciplines his dogs and goes on a 5 minute rant screaming and swearing at me about how people like me are the problem and why dogs need to be disciplined and how I look etc. completely unprovoked and completely rude. The whole time I’m just trying to calm him down and explain what’s happened and when I finally get through to him he suddenly changes demeanour and gives me a half hearted sorry, I’m clearly traumatised and shocked by the random yelling he did at me and shake my head saying it was uncalled for, he proceeds to continue yelling at me saying he didn’t actually care if he hurts anyone and he doesn’t give a fuck. 

I didn’t spend more time arguing with him because he was clearly going through something but now that I’ve gotten home I can’t stop feeling jarred and shaken and bursting into tears randomly.

I gotten GI Testing’s done, checked for H pylori, a colonoscopy, an endoscopy, everyone is healthy and normal. My GI specialist said it sounds like it’s stress related, asked if I’ve been stressed lately. 2024 was a train wreck for me, but I’m not “stressed” per say at the moment, more so ANXIOUS and on the verge of panic everytime I feel nausea . I’ll be at a public place, I’d feel saliva accumulating, then I’ll start to clench my jaw and I can’t speak to people, I even start to feel tingling in my feet and hands, sweat behind my neck and ears, I can’t swallow because it’s like my throat is prepping itself for the vomit to come out. It’s horrible, I’ve had to cup my mouth with my hand and run to the washroom during work on multiple occasions, but nothing comes out. I used to dry heave but now I don’t need to, breathing kinda helps, but there’s times where it gets worse. I just don’t know how to fix this. It’s taking over my life, i just got married 2 months ago and it sucks not being able to enjoy going on dates or spending time in public, my worst fear is not making it to the toilet/washroom if I’m sick, since I havnt been sick in years.

Some things to note:

1) gets worse on my period
2) fizzy drinks help me burp which somehow relieves it temporarily.
3) I notice when I’m constipated due to stress it gets worse.

I was trying to get everything into the car because it seems they didn't want to help me with my bags at all, and as I am putting all of my things into the car, my mom comes up from behind me and just starts telling me how I am doing everything wrong, and then she tells me that my pants are falling down and she can see my skin. At this point I am so frustrated from everything that I start scratching my face really roughly and close my eyes in anger and tears fall down my face as I'm grinding my teeth. I was seething, and super overstimulated and wanted to just scream and break everything and throw everything away. Does this happen to anyone else?

I have always had anxiety around these events but now it’s been very crippling and much more severe. I have both coming up next week and feel like canceling them. The thing I struggle with most is vitals (blood pressure and heart rate) because I know it’ll skyrocket due to nerves. My heart rate at home is 70bpm but will get as high as 165bpm at the doctors if I start panicking. What tricks have worked for you? Would it be a bad idea to take a sedative like Benadryl just to make it there and then discuss this anxiety with my doctor? Are there ways to lower heart rate and blood pressure day of?

868,Things are moving too fast for my brain,"I have begun experiencing severe anxiety about life. No obvious reason. I’m comfortably retired. Happily married. Same with my wife of 49 years. In fact, her stress level seems even worse and *may* be moving into depression. We both have trouble sleeping and predictively feel tired and sluggish during the day. We barely have the physical strength to do even the basic chores around the house; very little “drive” to do anything creative. Nothing in our last health exams lends any insight. We have not shared this with our adult children, in part because something feels *off* with them, as well:  like they’re struggling. Contact with them has fallen off. When we do visit, it’s over the phone and our focus is on them and catching up on their goings-on and such. We became accustomed to being by ourselves during the Covid outbreak. Created a habit perhaps, as we continue to stay fairly close to home and rarely see anyone. We’ve searched for answers and have read a lot of advice; but if I felt up to doing the things that are supposed to help, I wouldn’t need help! At this point I’m just hoping all of this will eventually pass.

i know that it's very possible i won't have to drive on the highway for the drivers test, but if i do have to, i need to be prepared. i also just need to learn how to be okay with the highway because i'm moving further away from my boyfriend and my lack of a license is becoming really inconvenient and imo disrespectful towards him since he does all the driving. 

has anyone else had this issue? if so, how did you overcome it?

as of late i seemingly just cannot exist without some all consuming anxious fixation and i’m so tired. first i entirely convinced myself i had pinworms (with ZERO evidence mind you), then it was ticks and a tick almost bit me in my own bed, then spiraling about possibly being pregnant (again with no real evidence), and now the latest: bedbugs.

i went on vacation with my family this pat week and it was lovely! unfortunately the mosquitos did get me pretty good just while laying in bed/sleeping and i ended up w quite a few bites. i tried to be good and not fall down the google rabbit hole to avoid another weird anxiety episode — despite the possibility of bedbugs weighing on me heavily — and all was well. that is until we got home and my mom was like “hm i wonder if it actually was bedbugs”. unfortunately for me it seems actually very likely. the ONE time i was able to keep myself from spiraling it turns out my anxiety was right! so not only do i now have to deal with the paranoia these things entail for me, my anxiety just feels justified now. 

i am just so tired of CONSTANTLY feeling like i’m going crazy over something completely insignificant to most other people. it is so frustrating to be self aware enough to know how ridiculous this all is but yet be unable to really stop any of it. i wish i could just be normal because i cannot keep doing this.

880,I feel alone.,"I'm eighteen years old with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD that I take medication for, Generalized anxiety disorder that I take medication for as well as tourette syndrome and a sleep disorder and dyspraxia. 

Anyways, I feel alone, because I'm extremely disconnected from my family. The reason being is because my mum who I adore a lot is the black sheep of our family, so that indirectly made me the black sheep of the family too when I was born.
My family dislikes my mum, because of a lot of mistakes she has done but she's no criminal at all. She's a loving and caring individual. 
She suffered a lot when she was young, causing her to develop PTSD as well as anxiety and depression and BPD (Borderline personality disorder). 
I have two siblings, one brother and one sister, I'm the youngest. 
My sister also adored our mum just like me, they were like peas in a pod until she was seventeen: She met a lad called Michael and was never the same again, she turned extremely rude and aggressive towards my mum, constantly got into arguments with eachother. 
Ever since then, she was never the same and today, my mum and her don't talk, it goes on and off but they never shared the bond like they used to. There is more details but I won't go into it. 
As for my brother, he is in jail and has been in jail for 4 years and that might be another 3 years added considering he didn't listen to his probation officer when he got out after those 4 years. In fact, his trial is in a couple of weeks to see if he'll get three years or not. 
He has a history of doing drugs and theft as well. 
My mum doesn't talk to her mum either, they haven't spoke in almost two years and have never really spoke at all. 

As you can see, my family is incredibly broken, well, for me it is. I want to clarify 
I have never been verbally abused, physically abused or mentally abused, I haven't faced any trauma in my childhood. 

My dad wasn't in the picture at all. The last time I saw him was when I was seven years old. 
I visited him at a contact center when I was a child. 

As I said before, my mother was a loving individual and a caring one at that and her heart is pure but that's also a weakness my siblings like to play on: They often only call her for money and it angers me. 
My mum was a helicopter mum towards me, always taking care for me significantly and very overprotective which caused me to develop attachment issues towards her to the point where I'm scared she'll abandon me one day even though I know deep down she'll never do that until her last dying breathe. I have to go everywhere with her, because of this debilitating fear of mine, I have to phone her when she goes shop aswell. 

Anyways, this all gets to the point of my fear; I'm extremely worried of being independent and alone, the thought of having my own apartment terrifies me, the thought of paying rent, bills, etc scares me. I'm extremely worried about my future, that I'll end up all alone with no one to turn too.
I'm so used to my mother taking care of me. 
I'm extremely academically intelligent but socially I'm extremely unintelligent. 

Any questions, thoughts, opinions, please feel free to share them the best you can. 

TLDR: I'm terrified of my future and scared of being alone because of my disconnected family. ",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ivnqin/i_feel_alone/,One-Concentrate-7204,1740244653.0,anxiety

884,Fear of people misinterpreting my words online,"Apologize for the throwaway account but I always feel the compulsion to start clean on new Reddit accounts.

I’ve had several OCD themes over the past several years, but it’s very rarely one of the common themes that I hear other people talk about.

My latest theme is a fear of people misunderstanding/misinterpreting my words, especially online. I’m very careful with how I word things now, but there are several things I wrote online (comments, messages) that I wrote in the past that I’m still terrified of people misinterpreting. Looking back at some of those, I think a lot of the things I said could VERY easily be misinterpreted because of how poorly I worded them. I also sometimes fear that people will misremember things I say.

The fear is that people will misinterpret things I say and think things about me that aren’t true. Even very mundane things. Most of my OCD is identity based. But the thing is, I’m fairly secure in how I feel about myself, but my main concern is how others view me. Most people with OCD surrounding their identity seem to be focused on how they view themselves, but mine is an obsession with how other people view me. 

I just wanted to hear people’s thoughts on this because I’ve never seen anyone with this obsession (per usual with almost all of my themes, so it’s harder to find people to relate to and feel support from other people with OCD). I was doing ERP for almost a year but I quit recently because it just wasn’t helping. I’m just one of the people it’s not effective for.

889,Surviving ADHD at 20: My Journey So Far,"





Turning 20 has made me reflect a lot on the journey I’ve had with ADHD. It hasn’t always been easy, and there were times I thought I’d never get through it. But here I am—thriving, learning, and embracing who I am with ADHD.

For years, it felt like my mind was always racing, bouncing from one thing to the next without a clear path. The constant struggle to stay focused, manage time, and keep up with responsibilities made me feel overwhelmed. But over time, I’ve discovered that ADHD doesn’t have to define me or hold me back.

In my 20s, I’ve learned to build routines that work for me. I use tools like planners and digital reminders to stay organized. I also give myself grace when things don’t go as planned. I’ve accepted that my brain works differently, and that’s okay.

Through therapy, medication, and surrounding myself with people who understand and support me, I’ve found ways to thrive. I’ve also learned to embrace the unique strengths that come with ADHD, like creativity, problem-solving, and hyper-focus on things I’m passionate about.

The biggest lesson? It’s all about balance. ADHD is part of who I am, but it doesn’t define me. I’m still learning and growing, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

If you're navigating ADHD, no matter your age, know that you're not alone. It’s a journey, but survival—and success—is possible.

i’m also starting school again on monday & i literally don’t know how i’m going to manage. the thought of being in class for 3 hours is making my heart race. there’s just so much going on & i feel like i can’t handle it 🫠

893,Not sure if Remeron withdrawal or Seroquel side effects?,"I had some anxiety that was making it hard for me to eat so my dr put me on Remeron (mirtazapine). It didn’t really help me much and I’d get a lot of lightheaded/dizzy feelings as well as bad stomach issues like burning and GERD so we decided to switch to Seroquel. 

Here is my timeline: 5 days 15mg remeron -> 2 weeks on 7.5mg remeron -> now been on Seroquel for 4/5 days.

I will take issues I am dealing with at work and try to solve them, but am told my myself and others I am too stupid and why am I even trying.

907,having slow cognition and a lame personality,"I feel like my job contributes to my feelings of inadequacy. In every interaction I am a subordinate, the newbie who needs to be able to laugh at himself and take tough criticism day in and day out. However, I have such low self-esteem and such a difficult time learning on the fly (not to mention actually remembering what I’ve learned) that I am frustrated and embarrassed every single day at work. I hate the way I’m too slow to banter with customers and too boring to be liked by my coworkers. Even in the scant free time I have away from this job, I am regarded lowly and ignored. My brother looks down on and criticizes me, while even my dad wants less to do with me than him. My mom respects him more as well. My best friend doesn’t even respond to my quips or comments sometimes, she’s so disinterested. I try to let my natural personality shine through, but afterward I realize that what I say without a filter is boring or annoying most of the time. I don’t have the magnetic personality that I always wished to have and admired to no end. I am not an interesting, funny, or exciting person and no matter how much I attempt to improve my personality, that much is ingrained in my being. Talking more has not helped me become more likeable, so maybe the key to being more likeable is to talk less instead. My personality is pretty bad, so people tend to like me better when I show less of it. Better to be the mysterious yet lonely quiet person rather than the known and ridiculed talkative person. In neither scenario am I truly happy, though. I can’t help thinking the certain rejection by the masses might be worth it to have a couple more friends who tolerate me. Then again, it may turn out that truly no one likes me and I will be irrevocably crushed by that certainty. I wish I was witty, excitable, creative, and cool. Instead I just come off as desperate when I try to be liked and annoying when I don’t. It doesn’t seem like there’s any way to just be better, because I’ve tried improving my personality for so long with scarcely anything to show for it. I fundamentally dislike myself, so how can I expect anyone else to like me? I can’t CBT my way into thinking differently, I simply wish I had traits that I do not have, no matter how hard I have tried to acquire them. If I cannot improve and I cannot accept myself as I am, then I am a hopeless case. People might love or care for me abstractly, but they do not enjoy me as I enjoy them. No one really cares about me, not personally anyway. No one would care if I was gone, not like they’d be missing out on anything by not having me there. Disliked by everyone, including myself.

I have realized through my interactions with people that my lack of quick wit and emotional expression makes my personality thoroughly boring and unremarkable to interact with. This realization has helped me to understand why my previous girlfriends were very attracted to me on an aesthetic level, but grew less interested in talking to me the longer the relationship progressed. I have nothing to offer beyond gifts, services, and my looks. No one has ever truly been attracted to my personality, even when it comes to friendships. My one good, lasting friendship I still have is built on my acceptance of her personality, not any interest in mine. When I try to voice my opinions, tell my stories, or crack my jokes, she is not very interested and does not ask follow-up questions. Friends and partners never really enjoy my personality and prefer the company of their other friends most of the time. This is despite me trying for years now to make myself interesting and fun to talk with. It has not worked at all beyond some superficial social skills, so my lame personality remains unchanged. I feel that it is pointless to try and make friends when nearly everyone ignores me, and dating would only lead to a superficial attraction at best, which would fizzle out as they got to know my boring self. Yet, if I don’t at least try, then this loneliness becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I’m just so fed up and exhausted.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ivohli/having_slow_cognition_and_a_lame_personality/,blueplateaux,1740246512.0,anxiety

909,Bad night,"Hi all

Last night I had a really bad night and barely slept. What bothered me the most was how it manifested. I really don't know if I actually fell asleep before it happened but like a hour in I started getting what I can only call racing thoughts. But they weren't coherent. They were just random images with a sense of impending doom or that something bad was going to happen. I started to panic, sweating, etc. I was afraid I was going insane and was going to need hospitalization. I was scared to move. Eventually I did and took some propranolol and half a 50mg trazadone. It slightly improved somewhat but I was still shaken up and really didn't get clear headed until I got up.

Does anyone experience this? When I hear people mention racing thoughts they are usually in response to the day... I was really scared because of the nonsensical images.

If so, how do you snap out of it? For sleep I was given 50mg trazadone but honestly I may take a little more tonight (cut another 50mg in half) because I need sleep.

I was recently given 10mg of hydroxizine too if that might also help when this happens

Big mistake , I got a horn and swearing at me. There was a pub and I think a lot of people saw too:(. I'm usually really careful crossing streets.

There was a route to walk back home instead of heading to the park so I did that, I was holding back tears.

922,My life feels so blurry and low resolution?,"I remember I used to still feel things about up until I graduated high school but recently life has become so dull. I have no imagination anymore and I can't even sit alone with my thoughts. I used to go so many places in my head and see such vivid colors. Now all I can imagine is my worries so I fill my head with more content from the moment I go to bed to the moment I wake up. I take a walk every day and try to read once every few months but these are the only moments of peace I have. I can't stop scrolling because I want my mind to feel how it used to feel and I want novelty. I used to be able to create this myself but I can't anymore due to several episodes of depression and eating disorder that made my apathy worse. It has sucked the life out of every moment and dulled down every experience. I used to pride myself on how much I enjoyed beauty, nature, and creativity, but now I feel nothing when I see those things. My life has no spontaneity but the surprises that do come are always negative, which makes me want my miserable routine again.

I honestly fear that I have lost myself because I do not recognize my thoughts. I haven't had a thought that didn't have some sort of neurotic origin in so long. The only times my brain cares to work are to let me know I am in danger or I am a failure. I do not perceive the possibilities right in front of me because the neural pathways for that seem to have been shut off from repeatedly being rejected and disappointed my my father. I want my own mind back and I don't recognize myself. I am a neurotic mess and I rarely say or think anything interesting anymore. I wear myself out and others out with my worries and then numb my brain out when I get too tired. It's a cycle that never ends and never gets anywhere. I don't even care if I am productive anymore, I just want to feel sometime moving in my mind that isn't neurotic. It can be anything that reminds me who I used to be and who I can become, preferably not on the internet all the time. I am trying to create a routine but it is hard to get my mind to stick to anything because I will literally zone out and just sit there due to the lack of dopamine in my brain.

I was doing so well for 1.5 years after I started medication and therapy for my anxiety disorder.

Then last December I was put off medication and I was doing so well. I was so happy like ""wow no medicines!""

But in January, one day I had a bad acid reflux and went to the hospital. They overreacted about my condition and misled me to the point where I experienced an Anxiety attack and my doctor put me back on meds.

It's going to be 3 weeks on meds and I'm still getting anxiety attack due to anticipatory anxiety about going back to the city where I work and where that whole acidity reflex thing happened. I've been home with my parents for a month and it feels like my safe space that I don't wanna leave.

Last therapy session (yesterday) I cried a lot asking why can't I just be a normal person? Why am I like this? I didn't do anything wrong in life.

Even now I feel miserable. I am not depressed. I'm only anxious and upset about it. At times I feel like I'm so broken that no man will love me, they'll get frustrated and cheat on me.

I just want to be a normal human, I want to build a bright career, fall in love and get married, have kids. I'm dreaming all of the things that I didn't last year.

I feel like I am caught in between “what if this happens, what if that happens” and I need to fight my anxious thoughts.

And it is draining because I am trying to solve both the problems my anxiety tries to solve and the anxious thoughts itself.

Because my brain is always on overdrive trying to solve my imaginary and real problems, I become short tempered.

Little things tick me off, my friends point that out but I can’t even explain why I get angry because I don’t know why I got angry that time.

I probably need some alone time to recharge.

927,I just want to quit,"I’m having a lot of health issues and need to get tests done and go to the doctor, and my manager is MAD because of these many appointments, every time she comes near me I think she’s gonna ask to talk to me to fire me, I can already hear her asking to talk to me.

I’m having anxiety about everything, and I’m not sure how to tell her that I have more appointments next week because she nearly screamed at me last week saying I “make too many appointments”.

She legally can’t fire me for being sick but she can lie and say it’s because of something else. We don’t really have an HR, she’s HR, so there’s nothing I can. I always have a doctor’s note which means she can’t dock my pay but she can be mad.

I kinda want to quit so I don’t have to worry anymore, about telling her about appointments or tests, having to miss work and being seen as a bad employee. I just want to quit so I can do what I need and not have to worry about being fired. 

But my resume is stained because I was fired from my last job after three months, and quitting this one after six months wouldn’t be helpful either. It took me a year and a half to get this job, that’s how long I was unemployed for and I don’t want to go through that again but I’m afraid.

I don’t know how to talk to my manager anymore, I can’t look at her in the face AGAIN and tell her I have more appointments.

This makes perfect sense to me but I have no clue what the root of my anxiety is.

929,Anxiety update,"So, in the first week of September, at my Sister-in-law’s wedding, I started having a monster of a panic attack. It was intense, but wore off in about 2 hours. 2 days later, while out with my wife and suffering from a migraine, I felt a crack/pop in my skull and ended up needing to get an ambulance to hospital. I was given all kinds of meds and tested for possible heart/brain/neuro issues.  Over the next months, I’ve used tons of meds/therapy/hidden out from the world. Now, here towards the end of February, the flu is kicking my ass - but life is different. I’ve gotten help from doctors to get off meds. I’ve built up to the ability to play music, see friends, and walk around a bit. I can do some things around the house, go grocery shopping, and clean around the house. Am I healthy? Nah. Not yet - but I am SO much better than I was. I still fear stroke/heart attack/brain aneurysm- but I’ve learned to lean into my panic and let it pass rather than fighting it. I’m not “normal” yet. And I might not be for a long time. But for anyone else struggling I just wanted to share that things can and will get better.

931,"My anxiety journey, ups and downs","I am just brain-dumping at this moment.

**2018**

The earliest moments when I can think of when my anxiety starts popping would be these events:

 - I did leg squats excessively and suffered from delayed onset muscle soreness on my thighs. The thigh cramps were worse to the point my mother was forced to stay at home to accompany me - because I was terrified of who could help me when the cramps would happen.

 - A few months later, I did push up excessively and suffered from shoulder blade pain. I found it hard to sleep because I was deeply afraid about the cramp that would happen. There was this one time I went to the emergency room because of the discomfort (not the anxiety). I moved temporarily out of my dormitory and stayed at a friend's house for a few days during the exam period - because I could not stay alone in my room.

**2020**

 - During the pandemic, I spent most of the first few months with my friends who were my housemates at that time. When the restrictions were relaxed for a moment, my housemates went back to their hometown, except for me. The first night that I was alone in the house, I could not relax. My heart rate skyrocketed. I called a friend who was staying nearby with his family to accompany me for a while and then he went back. I managed to sleep alone for the first night. The second day, I stayed at a friend's house (he returned earlier than other people).

 - A few weeks later, the anxiety caused me to have a choking sensation - probably from the gastritis due to anxiety. This is where my main problem with anxiety appeared - difficulty swallowing foods. I transitioned to softer foods such as porridge. The problem disappeared and reappeared throughout Q4 of 2020, but getting worsened. I had stomach discomforts - probably from the gastritis too.

**2021**

 - Early in January - I decided to return to my hometown and work from there (I do WFH and still doing WFH). I cried in front of my family telling them about my predicaments. My appetite was worsening, I could not finish food as before.

 - Early in February, I decided to go to a psychiatrist. My family has experience with mental illnesses with other family members, so they are supportive. My diagnosis - anxiety disorder.

 - Mar - went for an endoscopy to treat my GERD

 - April - I went to occupational therapy. The therapist advised me to start eating food as before, in smaller amounts, so that my mouth and throat could adapt to the sensation again.

 - June-December - My appetite was getting better. I could finish a normal amount of food.

**2024**

 - Early in January - the eating discomfort started to appear again. I started to shun food again.

**2025**

 - Current: I am still having eating discomfort. I am no longer eating food as normally as I want. I tried a protein shake (weight gain) to replace the calorie deficit, but after a medical screening, my renal function was not satisfactory, so the doctor advised me to stop the protein shake for a while until they could diagnose the cause. The psychiatrist prescribed an additional medicine - but it caused immense drowsiness.

I wish I could eat as normally again.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ivj709/my_anxiety_journey_ups_and_downs/,AzAcc31,1740232365.0,anxiety
932,House party anxiety,"TW: mentions of alcohol, substances

Hi all, I want to start by saying that this subreddit is by far one of the most welcoming and safe spaces I have seen. I'm proud for all of you struggling every day and for all of you helping each other. 

Tonight my boyfriend (32M) and ME (33F) will host a house warming party for our new flat. It was his idea, I'm not a big fan of house events as they bring me anxiety. To explain this: I am very bonded to my items, I don't want people to ruin them, I feel it is too loud, I am stressed that I have to entertain everyone to have a good time, and I feel suffocated because I cannot leave, since it's my own place. 

I have GAD and mild depression and I am on medication for quite some time now and overall my life is fine, I have good supportive friends and family and my partner is lovely.

However, this time with the house party, we had many disagreements. I wanted it to keep it in a small circle (I have like 5-6 friends I actually like) but he wanted a huge event of 30 plus people. He even invited some random people that he sees once per year, some others that 2 years ago invited him to their party and never saw each other, some people that they just sent ig reels and some friends of his that do not invite him to their stuff, but my boyfriend wants to invite them because he claims he is an inclusive and nice person and he doesn't hold grudges. 

I told him that I would have never have invited all these randoms and especially friends that are not even real friends. He told me that I am keeping score of who did what to me and that's how I end up with so few people. However I am very proud of my few people, we would do everything for each other. I'm not excited that he is inviting all these strangers into our flat, that we have to feed them and provide them with drinks and so on, for them to forget about it and then see him again in a year. I didn't like that we had to buy all these stuff for fake friends. It looks dishonest to me and I don't want them here. He never sees them, why do they have to be here? He was claiming it is important for him and that we throw the party for the people not for us, that we give them the opportunity to have fun and to meet new people. Oh well my flat is not tinder and it's not a bar. I don't have to make all these people happy by bringing them to my flat. Sorry. 

Long story short, it's tonight. I'm bitter and estranged the whole day. I dread every minute of it. I can't wait for tomorrow to come. I have zero excitement. We even argued about a big chair I have, as I want it to be hidden because it is special to me and I'm afraid people will ruin it, and he said that we have to show the chair to people cause it's beautiful. I'm dreading this, the chair will smell like cigarettes and it might be ruined from wine. I cannot win in any argument. He says it is one day per year and I have to let him manage this. I cannot. I'm out of my mind, I already dread the noise and all the people here and the drinks. 

Needless to say there will be mild substance use as well, to which I also opposed. We are already giving them so much food and drinks, do we have also to roll a J for them? He was insisting that people need to have fun. I'm very negative about it. I don't understand what is fun, he says. 

I literally told him it's the worst day of the year for me. I'm a very good friend, I have a close circle of friends, they know I am stressed as f tonight and they ll be there for me to help me. One of them is my bestie and she will take me to her place nearby if I feel overwhelmed. But except them, there will be also a bunch of people that I don't know, that I see as freeloaders, I legit don't understand why we feed and give drinks and substances to a bunch of people we never hang out with. I feel like a charity. 

I'm gonna take half a xanax and see how the evening goes. I hate every single minute of this, I hate that I had to fight with him, I hate that I feel like that, I hate that he wins with all his arguments and I hate parties. I told him I feel like he is my enemy in all this, he knows house events stress me and yet he managed to take it to a level that I can't even manage. I was stressed last summer when we invited 7 people for sushi. I managed and it was fine but I really wanted everyone to leave at 12. They did, cause they were my friends mostly and they know me. Now how will I tell random strangers to get out? 

And yet although he knows this he exaggerated. I feel bitter and annoyed at him for putting me in this position and he feels sad and guilty for doing so and for not letting him enjoy the party. All I think is my furniture, my items, the cleaning, the mess, the music, the noise. Thank God there is xanax.

936,I’m triggered and I can’t stop panicking,"I’m 24(f) and recently I had a coworker just stop liking me. Like we were friends and then all of a sudden he just won’t talk to me or anything. I tried to ask him about it yesterday and he was just really mean and cold and short. It’s just making me panic. It’s triggering me to my childhood when it felt like my parents didn’t like me and then my friends in high school just all abandoned me and made fun of me. It just is triggering me so bad.

I’ve been on and off crying and panicking since 9pm last night. I woke up at like 7am to which I normally go back to sleep because I work late, but I can’t shake the feeling. I had dreams over and over again all night long about it.

It feels so stupid to care about something so stupid, but I really am having such a hard time getting over it. I tell myself it’s okay that people don’t like you they’re allowed to not like you, but then every time I think about it my chest tightens and I just cry and cry. My nose is raw from crying so much.

No one understands because they will just think I’m being really crazy because I am. I really don’t know how to get past this. Right now, I just never want to go to work again. 

This coworker used to be my friend and he’s nice to everyone but me. He’ll talk all night long to everyone but then when I come around silence. I just wish I didn’t ask him about it and kept ignoring it. I think it was the wrong thing to do for the situation but my boyfriend kept telling me to try to to figure out why and try to talk about with him. But it just confirmed my fears.

And it shouldn’t matter. But it does matter so much to me. I’m basically spiraling out of control. I feel like I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t stop crying, I couldn’t bring myself to shower, and then I have to go back to work later. And I’m pregnant so I need to take care of myself but I feel such a roadblock.

It makes me feel like I want to hurt myself. I won’t because I’m pregnant. I used to punch myself in the face until I got dizzy and I just want to do that so bad. I’m driving my boyfriend insane because I don’t know how to cope. I just want him to cope for me and I’m putting a lot of my emotion on him. I just can’t stop crying.

My boyfriend works with me and he’s friends with him because they work in the back together and they play video games together. It just hurts my feelings so bad.

I feel like I have nobody. Nobody should like me because I’m pathetic. I just want to hide. I don’t want to do anything but cry and hide.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ivigf5/im_triggered_and_i_cant_stop_panicking/,Overall_Evidence_838,1740230037.0,anxiety

939,Panic Attacks Out of Nowhere - 24/7 Anxiety and Air Hunger Now,"I've (26f) yet to be diagnosed (love it here in America, too broke to investigate) - but I've been having frequent panic attacks and nearly 24/7 ""air hunger"" since about 2 months ago - seemingly out of nowhere. 😢I've already done blood work and an EKG to rule out the initial worry with some heart palpitations and those tests came out completely fine. I just constantly feel ""on edge"". Recently, it's affected my sleep as well. I'm typing this now super early in the morning, way before I intended to be up, because I find myself unable to fall asleep without a spike in anxiety right before I'm able to knock out. My heart rate shoots up, feels like it's pounding out of my chest and I hyper-focus on it, feels like I can't breath even though I AM BREATHING. 

U G H. 

I know this isn't *completely* out of nowhere. I've been dealing with external stressors in my life for YEARS now, but the panic attacks are definitely new. I'm a casual THC gummy enjoyer and they've always been fun to take/do a good job at relaxing me. I've ""greened out"" in the past where I've definitely taken too much and have had anxiety/panic attacks as a result, but those were always one-shot situations that I was able to move past from. For some reason though, around 2 months ago, I had a big panic attack while on a gummy that I feel HAS to have something to do with how I'm feeling now. It's weird because??? Again, it's happened before and I've always been able to be like ""lol that was scary, anyways-"" and just move on. But my anxiety has carried on after the fact. Needless to say, I haven't been able to really enjoy THC since.

I'm also developing major health anxiety because of all this. The symptoms FEEL so real - and they are ""real"" in terms of how it's affecting my body. But all my symptoms (panic, dread, dizziness, pounding heart, palpitations, air hunger, waking up in the middle of the night, sudden bouts of fear and needing to use the bathroom) are all synonymous with anxiety. I just feel so ridiculous. Like I KNOW in my heart it's anxiety, but I'm so worried that maybe I'm missing the mark and something is actually wrong with me health-wise. So I spiral. 

I really just want to get back to how I was feeling before that big panic attack 2 months ago. Now anything sets me off. I miss not being at all aware of my body unless I NEEDED to be (as in: sore muscles after working out or period cramps, stuff like that). Now I'm always keying into my breathing, my heart rate, my concentration, etc...

I'm trying to manage this independently for now with meditation and critical thinking. So for example: if I start having a panic attack or begin to feel a spike in my anxiety, I'll do some breathing exercises and remind myself that my bloodwork was good, my EKG was good, my blood pressure was good, blah-blah-blah. And that does help! But if I have to KEEP doing that as often as I've needed to lately (multiple times a day, daily)...I may need to consult a doctor for some medicine. Living like this is exhausting.

947,"I don't know what to do anymore, I want to give up","I've been suffering from depression basically my entire life, I always set it aside because I don't want other people to see my vulnerable side. I'm a male and I'm 21 yo. I told no one about it, not even my parents, I hide it so well no one will even get the slightest of inkling that I was depressed, but recently I've had nights that I would just cry, its like all of the pain I've set aside hits me like a truck. I always make mistakes despite trying my best, and when I do those mistakes I send myself into a shame spiral that I can never get out of. 

I've always had no friends, just a small small few whom I don't talk to anymore these days so I wouldn't consider them as friends anymore, nobody invites me to anything, nobody checks up on me, the people I used to game with started having girlfriends/boyfriends and started to be distant, which I respect. More power to them. I can never maintain a good relationship with someone, be it a romantic or friendly relationship. Its always I did something wrong, I did too much, or I didn't do enough. I'm sick of it. 

Recently I've been talking to this girl, really nice girl, (24F) and she has work, she makes me happy and I would say she feels the same way, we're not together yet and we're long distance, different countries to be exact. We've been talking for about two and a half month now, recently we've had a small argument. TLDR, I  made a small mistake and now we're barely talking. I'm doing all I can to win her back but she wont budge. Just like that, a snap of a finger I think I pushed someone away again. And I have been thinking about it non stop ever since, its a mixed feelings of shame, regret and depression. I hate myself for always sabotaging great things that happen to me. The worst thing is that I actually try to be better, I'm so anxious of what I say, I replay multiple scenarios in my head before even doing something, but still I end up killing what I find happiness in and I hate it, I want it to stop, but I can't seem to find a way out of this cycle that I put myself through. I don't know what to do, or even if I can do something about it. 

I also hate what I took for may major. I bit more than I can chew, but I'm afraid I'm too deep to back out. (3rd yr civil eng major).

I procrastinate, I cram deadlines, I don't get along with people because I'm not used to it. I hate it, I feel like I have nothing, no side hustle, no talent, no future, no path. I'm lost.

950,Getting an echocardiogram,"I’ve been having horrible panic attacks and anxiety especially around when I need to sleep. A couple weeks ago I was up for 30 hours and whenever I would lay down I would lose my breath so I sat back up and stayed awake until my dad could take me to the urgent care. I’m 24, 6ft 1, 128lbs. They ran my vitals then sent me to the er to make sure it wasn’t a blood clot in my lungs. I explain to them I get this constant pain on my left side and top left of my chest. Also strain my shoulders by keeping them tense whenever this is all going on. Almost a physical pain turned to a mental panic and I freak myself out. I went to the er, after hours of waiting everything came back negative, they gave me hydroxyzine which helped for a little bit until I had a doctors appointment. Explained the same thing, they gave me buspirone. I’m now taking that twice a day and they said to be safe they want to get my heart looked at to make sure it isn’t enlarged. So here I am having to wait until March 31st and that isn’t making my issue much better. Also quit the hyrdroxyzine bc it was starting to freak me out almost making me panic more than I was before taking it until literally blacking out passing out a few hours later everytime and I hated that. So im only taking buspirone 2x a day which I also dislike bc it does not help my pain or panic attacks whatsoever, if anything it just cuts off the fight or flight and hyperventilation aspect. I used to be prescribed klonopin for these panic attacks and it worked so great, my current doctor doesn’t like giving that out bc it’s addictive, but I truly only used it as needed. This could all be stemming from the fact I quit long term smoking a few weeks ago, and last time I quit I was just able to use klonopin and I was completely fine. My doctor told me to contact a psychiatrist if that’s what I want to be on so badly so I did and applied online yesterday hoping that works out. But for now im up almost every night until im not able to keep my eyes open anymore. Constantly throughout the day just stretching my arms trying to not feel that uncomfortable tightness in my shoulders my heart my chest whatever it is that’s causing it I don’t know but it’s driving me insane. Was frustrating bc my doctor told me after I asked to switch medication that im not giving buspirone a chance, and that my panic is stemming from anxiety, when I truly feel this panic is giving anxiety afterwards. So if was able to take something to just relax (benzo) in that moment I would be completely okay. And the klonopin would make me feel very much okay for 2+ days minimum sometimes even make it so I don’t feel the need to take it for months and months. The weed withdrawals definitely aren’t helping my case, and stressing about this echocardiogram and being on buspirone when I truly feel it’s not treating me correctly. Just all stresses me out more and I worry im putting wear and tear on my body because of it.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ivg21f/getting_an_echocardiogram/,Cumrin,1740220877.0,anxiety
951,Constant chest and back pain,"Hello everyone, I am looking for some support I feel like I am going insane! 

A bit of background about me - I am 19F and around the start of November last year I started experiencing some chest pain and upper back pain. 

This seemed to have backed off of a virus that I had but we aren't sure if that had anything to do with it. 

I had multiple hospital visits and I had bloods, ECG's, an echocardiogram, and a CT scan and nothing everything has come back fine. Pain killers seem do absolutely nothing.

About 7 weeks of agony the pain subsided and for about 2 and a half months I have been completely fine and pain free. However it has now come back? I am in agony again all the time. 
My symptoms are: 
- Pain in my chest which is sort of like a dull, achey pressure like someone is sitting in my chest and can occasionally be a bit stabby. 
- Pain in my upper back which is also dull and stabby.
- Shortness of breath when moving around and doing things 

Anyway I went back to my doctor and he seems to think it may be anxiety and has put me on anxiety medication. I am quite an anxious person but I am finding it hard to believe that my anxiety is causing me this much pain and all day everyday?! 

I am currently seeing a cardiologist and have a waiting on a MRI. Which I am getting next week. The only other thing I think it could be is costochondritis. 

I am not keen on anti anxiety medication as I don't want to become someone who relies on it. But can this really be due to anxiety, I don't feel very stressed at the moment. I just want some relief!

955,Trigger warning : abortion & death,"Apologies for the long post. I hope someone can stick with it long enough to help me.

I’ve always been indecisive, it’s something my family always mocked me for. I over think any decision and would often not make a decision for fear of not liking it in the future (eg. Decorating my bedroom as a teenager,etc).

I never thought of myself as having ‘anxiety’, perhaps I didn’t really know what it meant. A few years ago my dad was diagnosed with a progressive disease that gave him a life expectancy of approximately 8 years. This was shortly before I got married and I suffered some panic attacks at the time of his diagnosis.

After I got married I had my first child and the healing process was hard. I had some problems post birth that made me very worried and upset but I put that down to baby blues and genuine concern for how to solve the health problem. 

When I found out I was pregnant with my second my first reaction was panic but my husband quickly talked me down into excitement. Babies are all I’ve ever wanted.

After my second was born I was quite low some days but honestly it’s all a blur and I never really thought too much on it but my husband now mentions it looking back. 
A couple of minor events happened (problems with my front door, etc) that caused me huge amounts of stress and I went into overdrive calling people to try and get them fixed asap. I knew it was causing me severe stress but again never really recognised what I was doing as being ‘anxious’. These events did take over my life… I found myself getting therapy and the last event where a doctor prescribed me long term medication that wasn’t needed I got extremely worked up. 

Anyway.. fast forward to autumn 2024 and everything was settled, I didn’t really think I had long term mental health problems and the only ‘issue’ in my life was my extremely poorly dad that was causing me a lot of sadness. We decided to try for our third child. I got pregnant straight away and the minute I saw the test I went into complete panic. Within 24 hours any slight excitement had completely gone and I was spiralling into complete crisis. I had no idea it was ‘spiralling’, no one called it that until afterwards. I was absolutely convinced we’d ruined our other children’s lives and we would never move house (our home is too small). I was convinced that we’d still be here in 5 years time when it’s time for my older to go to secondary school and we would be ‘trapped’ and I’d spend my life feeling miserable like I’d let them all down. I spoke to my friend, mum and sister and they all said they were worried for my mental health and if I didn’t think I could cope with a third pregnancy then I should go ahead and have an abortion. I read into it and saw that all the information said you’ll feel ‘relief’, so against my own personal feelings on it (I’ve always thought I couldn’t cope with it) I went ahead and took the pills by post. My husband has always been anxious and his stance was that it was my choice and looking back he feels that as soon as I panicked, he fell into panic with me.

2 days later they hadn’t worked. No bleeding had started. I got referred in for a scan and blood tests and it became a ‘pregnancy of unknown location’. I spent a week being told the pregnancy may be continuing (then I’d have to face my decision again with the knowledge I’d taken harmful substances to end it), it may have been non viable to begin with or it may have been too early to detect on the scan (although my blood HCG results were high enough to suggest it should be detectable). It was the worst week of my life. I was terrified and alone and from the second I walked into the hospital and had a scan I knew I’d rushed into trying to ‘fix’ something that didn’t need fixing and I’d made the worst decision of my life.

A week later my dad had to go into hospital and we were told he needed to start palliative care. That started us as a family down a new horrible road and more for my mental load. We know that we are weeks maybe if we’re lucky then months away from my dad’s passing and he needs 24 hour care.

My husband then went ahead and had the conversations with mortgage advisers/accountant/etc that he needed to have and got more certainty on our ability to move. My mum also suggested we could move in with her. All in all, it felt like all of my worst fears for the pregnancy were alleviated only weeks later and it broke me.

Since all of this (it’s now been 4 months) I have been in a really, really bad place. I’ve been deeply depressed and have definitely learnt I have anxiety! I have a constant pain in my chest and racing heart, my head doesn’t stop reliving all the conversations that led me to the worst mistake of my life. No one understands. My sister just keeps trying to get me onto antidepressants but all I want is to get healthy again, avoid more medicine that makes me anxious and try again. I know I don’t deserve to try and have a baby again but it feels like going on more meds is closing the door on that and I will regret this forever.
I feel like I’m just floating through each day trying to get to the end of each day for my children and then hiding away and pretending the world doesn’t exist. I lost track of life, the date, etc back in November.

I don’t really know what im asking but ;

- does this sound like prenatal anxiety? (I have a referral to an anti natal trauma & loss service that I could take up)

- will I ever get past this? Or is this my setting for life now? I am so scared there’s no way forward and I’ve ruined my whole life and my family’s. 

- has anyone else been through similar and how did they get better?

I just wish I’d known I was someone who ‘spiralled’ and that I was someone who struggled in this way so that I could have sought help when it mattered. Since then my husband, mum and sister have all said ‘you were doing what you do and spiralling so fast!’ And acted like it’s my default setting so I just don’t understand why no one ever mentioned this before or tried to stop me long enough to take a breath and have a conversation atleast ..
Everyone else’s lives have carried on as normal and I just need to find a way out of this darkness for the sake of my children.

I am constantly going round in my head now and if and when we can have this third baby. How big the age gap is getting and if time is running out. I feel like I maybe just need to break the cycle and battle through and tell myself there will never be a perfect time and no matter how anxious I get I just need to get through it. Otherwise when will this end??

Recently I've been obsessed with this YouTube channel my best friend introduced me to called Chilling Scares. The channel covers a ton of creepy topics like unsolved and disturbing mysteries and the like. So anyways I've been binging their videos a lot in my free time, which hasn't been good for my mental at all. Recently I've become super paranoid that someone is constantly watching me through the windows in my house, even though I have really good blinds that block out pretty much everything. There are a few windows that don't have any blinds, and it's really hard for me to even look at them without wanting to scream. Thankfully I only feel this way when it gets dark out, but I'm worried about this getting too out of hand to where I start to lose sleep or dare I say I begin to feel this way during the day. I really hope I don't need to get a therapist, since they're probably expensive. I'm just going to hope that after I stop watching these videos, I'll go back to normal eventually.

hey people of Reddit. I’ll try not to make this long because I have a recent history of posting about my symptoms all the time and it could be quite annoying for others but for those who are interested keep reading. 

2 days ago I started have a “squeezing” or more better described as a pinching/cramp pain in my chest that’s not excruciating. it’s more so subtle but enough to keep me worried and for me to feel uncomfortable. I’ve gotten every single test. EKG, Bloodwork, Lungs, Echo, all of them came out good and labeled as “fantastic” in terms of how healthy my heart is. I got my first panic attack in December that started off as heartburn & since then I’ve had a recent history of acid reflux every single day from December until now. I don’t know if it’s cardiac because all my tests come back clear, definitely worries me though. I went to an urgent care yesterday and describe a whole LIST of symptoms I have and even told the doctor about the chest pain I’m having and he ran some tests, funny enough he turned to me when he got the results and said “you are worrying yourself to death and you are perfectly fine from what your vital signs are showing. You’ve got your heart checked and it came back clear and you’re still worried.” He mentioned the only issue I had that was pointed out was the fact I had acid reflux for 2 months straight so he prescribed me omeprazole and today is my first day taking it. 

Though many doctors have pointed out that I am very healthy I still don’t believe any of them. It may seem silly since they are the professionals and all tests are clear as day but I just can’t grasp the feeling that I am “okay” when I don’t feel okay. The pain is mainly on my left side of the chest and sometimes I get a funny feeling towards my sternum. I feel like im going crazy at this point. I will leave a list of things I have felt in the past couple of months that stemmed off the panic attack that doctors claim are healthy with clear results. 

Chest Tightness throughout my whole chest. Almost feels like a pressure/cramp
Panic Attacks
Left arm burning/Cold. (Both never occur at once)
Acid Reflux everyday for 2 months
Severe Stomach Burning 
Heartburn occasionally 
Constant Twitching in different parts of body 
Pins and needles (cold) 
Chest pains usually when I eat food or burp, lingers even after I eat. 
Burning in back shoulder blade 
Sore shoulders

Upon examination and EKG, the doctor said everything was normal and it was most likely just a symptom of anxiety. At some point I got used to it and tried to ignore it when it came on. But this week, at a random moment, I felt a sharp pain in the middle of my chest where my heart is. This pain was worse than all the previous ones and lasted about 15 seconds. When I straightened my back, it got stronger but then suddenly went away. I told my friend, who also suffers from anxiety, about it and she said a similar thing happened to her during anxiety. That calmed me down a bit, although I thought it was strange that I had this pain literally out of nowhere. And today I felt it again. After breakfast I was just doing household chores and all of a sudden I had this pain again, in the same place. This time it lasted about two minutes. Of course it made me panic.

Shortly after, I had a severe viral infection with intense symptoms, including a fever-induced episode that triggered a hallucination/nightmare.

This triggered overwhelming health anxiety—I convinced myself I had brain cancer, visited my university clinic seven times in 14 days, and was reassured I was fine. But my fears shifted to having a heart attack in my sleep, then to constant thoughts of death—mine and my loved ones’. It’s all I think about when I talk to someone or even see strangers—I wonder how they will die and if they’ve ever received bad news about losing someone. This has been my reality for the past four weeks.  

I’m seeing a CBT therapist, but so far, I’ve only learned physical techniques for panic attacks. My doctor prescribed Prozac, but I hesitate to take it since some people say it made them feel emotionally disconnected, which I already struggle with. I had my first good day today after reconnecting with friends, yet I still feel like happiness is temporary and that I’m just distracting myself. Even as I write this, I feel disconnected from reality.  

I’ve also noticed that almost everyone I ask says they’re not okay, reinforcing my doubts about whether life can truly be enjoyable. It might sound naive, but I keep wondering—how do people survive for years after losing a loved one or dealing with mental health struggles? My anxiety has consumed me to the point that I’ve lost 8 kilos in two weeks, and I struggle to eat or focus on anything else.  

For context, I’m academically gifted and have always believed that ""nothing bad can happen to me,"" since back home, the worst thing was failing an exam (a foolish thought in hindsight). I also love to have answers and solutions for everything. i have no history of mental health issues, but this experience has made me realize that real hardships are inevitable, and I doubt my ability to handle them. I’ve started losing friends, feeling depressed 24/7, and failing classes—completely unlike me, as I’ve always been able to bounce back quickly.  

I’d really appreciate any life advice. This might not seem like the biggest problem, but it’s disrupting my entire life and making me question everything.

974,Do you feel insufficient for not being perfect?/¿Te sientes insuficiente por no ser perfecto?,"English and Spanish



I know that I am not the only one who has ever felt less than others for not being as handsome, tall, having the best attributes, sharing the tastes of others, liking unpopular things, I know. Over time I have learned things that help me live and write “the story of my life.” To begin with, let's understand that we don't have to be governed by others, their tastes or what they indicate as great makes us happy? That's the main thing, really the best way to overcome these fears and insecurities is to understand that everyone will NEVER like you, there will always be someone who looks at you badly, but you must focus on who you are, your life is too short and focus on what you can do to like yourself. If you have an ugly nose, you are not tall, you are not white, what can you do? get self-conscious about it and waste the opportunity? Or understand that this is your life and that doesn't define your value? They have really always standardized that the beautiful boy or girl is better, you will always be a worse chance, but for whom? For the same people who feel less afterward when they see a model? Value is not defined by how you see yourself, you will never determine it because each person is the protagonist or the center of their own life, you must learn to write it and let others write their story. I share this experience and way of thinking for the number of people who think like me, I know I can help them and if they like, continue advising them. Remember, this is the story of YOUR life and you must write it every day, anything can happen, never have faith that you will be wrong. Greetings from your friend Bladow, I hope you like this. :)









Sé que no soy el unico que alguna vez se sintio menos que los demás por no ser tan guapo, alto, tener los mejores atributos, compartir los gustos de los demás, gustar de cosas no populares, lo sé. Con el tiempo he aprendido de cosas que me ayudan a vivir y escribir ¨la historia de mi vida¨. Para iniciar, entendamos que no tenemos que regirnos de otros más, sus gustos o lo que ellos indican como genial nos hace felices? eso es lo principal, realmente la mejor forma de superar estos miedos y inseguridades es entender que NUNCA le caeras bien a todos, siempre habra alguien que te mire mal, pero debes centralizarte en lo que eres, tu vida es demasiado corta y enfocarte en aquello que puedes hacer para gustarte a ti. Si tienes una nariz fea, no eres alto, no eres blanco, que puedes hacer? acomplejarte por eso y desaprovechar la oportunidad? O entender que esta es tu vida y eso no define tu valor? Realmente siempre han estandarizado que el chico o chica hermoso es mejor, siempre seras peor chance, pero para quienes? para las mismas personas que se sienten menos despues cuando ven algun modelo? el valor no se define en como te ves, nunca lo determinaras porque cada uno es el protagonista o el centro de su propia vida, debes aprender a escribirla y dejar que los demas escriban su historia. Comparto esta experiencia y forma de pensar para la cantidad de gente que piensa como yo, se que puedo ayudarlos y si gustan seguirlos aconsejando. Recuerda, esta es la historia de TU vida y debes escribirla cada dia, cualquier cosa puede suceder, nunca tengas fe en que estaras mal.

I’m a first-year college student, and lately, I’ve been feeling really lost. I don’t feel passionate about anything in life—whether it’s learning a new skill or even doing simple things that most people seem to enjoy, like riding a bike.

I’ve tried exploring different fields, but nothing seems to stick. I did a web dev course on Udemy for a month, then quit. I started learning machine learning, but I didn’t find that interesting either. It’s like no matter what I try, I lose interest quickly or just don’t feel excited about it.

Because of this, I’ve started questioning my purpose. I don’t even feel like I truly *exist*—and even if I do, what’s the point of living a life that feels so empty and directionless? It’s honestly making me nervous for the future.

981,long term propranolol?,"to cut a very long story short, i’m a university student and several months ago i started to experience nausea in my lectures. it was really strange because it only happened when i was in a lecture and would stop as soon as i left. over the past few months i started experiencing nausea in other situations such as in the car/ on public transport/ in other aspects of my life. i believed it may be anxiety related since as soon as i left these situations i felt fine. 

a few weeks ago i started to feel a lot worse and began experiencing other physical symptoms that were debilitating and made it really hard to leave the house. three weeks ago, i went to the doctor and they gave me a one off prescription of propranolol. the difference its made is incredible, my other physical symptoms have completely gone and it massively helps with my nausea in lectures and other places. i was told to take 10 mg 3 times a day max which has been plenty and i haven’t taken this much everyday, but most days i have. 

i had an appointment today to request another prescription and was told that propranolol is not supposed to be used long term, nor is it supposed to be used everyday which honestly came as a surprise to me. she issued another prescription but told me to use them more sparingly and more on an as needed basis. the doctor told me it may be worth considering an SSRI as an alternative, but i don’t really understand the issue if i’m finding the propranolol so useful. is it really so bad to take it for more than a couple of weeks? they keep warning me of the risk of overdose and also because it’s a doctors surgery on my university campus, i was told they don’t offer repeat prescriptions of propranolol to students. 

from what i know about SSRIs, adjusting to them can be quite challenging and i’ve only got 5 or 6 weeks left of university lectures so i may not even be able to reap the benefits. i was really just wondering why there is such resistance to prescribing propranolol in a case like mine when it’s helping so much, it’s allowed me to feel back to normal for the majority of the time.

i’ve also had an appointment with a mental health occupational therapist and we discussed other methods i can try to help, some of which help marginally, but without the propranolol i’m even struggling to get out the house. i’ve got an appointment with a university counsellor next week as well which i’m hoping will help. 

but short term, i’ve not found anything that’s helped me as much as propranolol has, and the fact i will probably be refused anymore next doctors appointment is quite concerning to me. whilst i’m trying to find other ways to manage this, i think having the option of propranolol is very comforting.

if anyone has any advice/ taken propranolol long term, i would appreciate any help or advice. thank you :)",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iv7aqi/long_term_propranolol/,crocodilepringles,1740188146.0,anxiety

My heart is pounding when I already know what my shift entails.

I’m worrying about shit that’ll happen in the next week and I keep telling myself it’ll be fine but my body decides on the opposite.

My stomach is constantly hurting. I’m always scared of throwing up. I can’t breathe properly.

I have no friends except my boyfriend. We never go on proper dates because i’m scared i’ll vomit or shit my pants in public. 

I want to try delicious food but I just physically can’t. 

I want to go out and explore and get my drivers license but I physically cant.

Same with why I never dated felt I needed to be more and accomplish things first.

I think Anxiety is even the reason I don't take certain art advice well, stuff about not trying to be perfect or not waiting until you have everything figured out before you start writing drawing seems to lend towards anxiety to me.

And my difficulty cleaning, I literally improved by leaps cleaning the house just by being able to scan documents in, meaning I don't need to stress as much about storing the files. also means I can scan the recipes my mother saved and toss them.

1002,I think I might be dying but can't afford it find out.,"I think I might be dying... recently, I've been having problems with breathing, and even more recently, it feels like my heart is skipping a lot. Like I'll be lying in bed, and all of a sudden, it's like I fall into myself, and I can actually feel my heart do something weird. 

Now the kicker is I can't afford to find out. If I miss work to go to the hospital or am actually sick I will probably be let go (also because of a couple other reasons). I also can't afford the visit to the hospital as it would cripple me.

Now people might say if you are sick or dying then it'll have to be worth the risk. And I get that. But if I'm not sick I will literally have destroyed my life over nothing. Will lose my apartment, My car and won't be able to support myself. 

I kinda inherited my job and since then I've gained a few pounds and won't be seen as a viable candidate for another position in my profession if I'm forced to find another job.

1003,I just want this mental torture to stop.,"The start to this year has been the absolute lowest point of my life. I've been through severe anxious phases, including DPDR, obsessive nihilism, relationship OCD/anxiety, you name it. 

It all started with me taking unprescribed adderall once on new year's eve. The next day, I was warned by my mom to not do laundry on new year's day because it will wash away a loved one (superstitious, i know). I ended up doing it anyway because I forgot. Fast forward to today, I am in constant, immense, suffering from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. It truly feels like the end of my life is near. And now I'm hung up on the fact that none of this would have happened if I didn't do laundry on new year's day, stupid, I know.

For the last week, my brain has had nothing but constant 24/7 images of my long distance girlfriend whom I love very much. Every day I wake up with a panic attack, heart racing, thinking about what if we break up, how I could live with the guilt of hurting her, what if our future doesn't work out.

It has become completely subconscious, I am 99% of the time depersonalized from reality, unable to focus on anything, and only can ruminate and overthink and constantly have this one singular image of her be in my subconscious mind 24/7 with no pause. 

It's become the default mode for my brain, whenever I'm bored, stressed, irritated, my mind subconsciously just goes back to that image and the worries that follow. It's completely taken over my mental capacity, I can't remember things, I can't think of past memories without the image of her interjecting itself into those memories, and I feel mentally broken.

I am too afraid to try and get rid of the 24/7 subconscious thought because I am scared that getting rid of the thought of her will make me inclined to not like her in reality.

This is complete mental torture and I am so afraid this will ruin our relationship and I truly don't know how much longer I can live like this and I just want this pain and suffering to end.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iv8t7r/i_just_want_this_mental_torture_to_stop/,RevolutionaryPay7899,1740192776.0,anxiety

One time I couldn’t leave the house for about a month due to a nightmare that took place on my block. Another time I locked myself in my room with my cats so that I can continuously check that they are ok and alive for a little less than 24 hours. 

Luckily enough I don’t really dream in the first place, until now though. I tried to pull an all nighter last night because Ive kept on having nightmare after nightmare for everyday in the past 2 weeks and I can’t take it anymore. I can’t really explain what I’m dreaming but I know it was terrifying. Every time I go back to sleep the nightmare continues or I get a newer “better” one. I get on average 3 nightmares a night. 

I’m starting my dream (badum tss) job in a week and I’m beyond excited but I will be working wack hours and I need to stay sharp and alert.

1009,i'm so frustrated. why won't doctors listen to me? it feels like nobody understands. i feel so alone,"TLDR : i have anxious intrusive thoughts and my doctor prescribed me benzos without even telling me what they were or what they do, thankfully i did research before taking them. (no offense to anyone who takes benzos btw, im glad they work for you!) now i'm doing my own research to try and find a med that will help me so i can tell him i want to take it, because i don't trust him anymore. (i'm moving in a few months so there's no use it finding a new doctor atm). i feel so alone like nobody understands. any advice or support or anything would be greatly appreciated <3 thank you!



I feel like nobody is listening to me and nobody understands and i feel so alone. ( sorry for the repeated sentence).  I have intrusive thoughts. like getting stabbed or shot, people breaking into my work or my house. thinking about people hating me and leaving me and ruining my life. it mostly manageable, i can still go about every day. but i've noticed that it's so exhausting and takes a lot of my mental energy. being anxious all the time sucks. it seems to mostly impact my relationship, probably due to trauma from my previous relationships. i always think my boyfriend's going to leave me, he doesn't love me anymore, or that i upset him all the time and im too much to handle. as for work, i'm so paranoid of doing the wrong thing or making mistakes. and then the intrusive thoughts on top of that is just alot. i hadn't realized how much this was affecting me until recently.  
i've had the same psychiatrist for probably 3 years now. he prescribes me my antidepressants and sleep meds and i haven't had any complaints with those thus far.  and honestly i normally just go in, sit there, and then he gives me my medicine. i don't like him very much at all, im just doing what i cant to get my medicine. i've wanted a new psychiatrist for awhile but never found a new one, maybe that's my issue here. but i'm moving with my family across the USA in a couple months and there's no use it finding a new one now. i figured i'd just wait until we moved to talk to somebody but i decided to give it a shot and try talking to him. the first time i told him about my anxiety and wanting to be put on anxiety meds, it seemed to go very well. i told him, he said ok, and put me on a medicine (buspirone). Well that didn't work, it could've been my bad sleep schedule but i got very depressed and arguably more anxious. my sleep schedule has been bad before though and didn't feel like that. i told him i don't want to keep taking that one. he randomly asks me if i think i have adhd and i said ""well my grandma had it so idk maybe"" and he asked me if i wanted to get tested and i said ""sure"", did the test, he didn't tell me my results. i had to ask him what they were. he asked if i wanted to go on adhd meds BEFORE EVEN TELLING ME MY RESULTS and then he said ""well there's some indicators of adhd but not a ton. do you think your anxiety is caused by not being able to focus"" i said no. WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME THAT BEFORE I TOOK THE ASSESMENT?? i asked if there was another anxiety med and he prescribed me on klonopin. didn't even tell me the risks, what it does, nothing. just told me some common side effects like dizziness and lightheadedness and told me to call if anything like that happened. i told my therapist about them and she mentioned something about them being strong. then i did my research to find out their benzos. he said nothing about addiction or anything. i have a very addictive personality. i was addicted to self harm for years, finally got out of that about 2 years ago now. almost all of my father's siblings are addicts of some kind. hell, my parents even drink a lot. i was about to take highly addictive pills and not even know it. (if klonopin or any other benzos work for you then that's great! i hope nobody thinks im putting them down because that's not at all what im trying to do. I'm so frustrated that he didn't even bother to tell me or ask, let alone even ask me how my anxiety manifests. i can easily sit here and blame myself for not being more clear with him about how i'm feeling, i do have anxiety after all, but i'm still so angry with him. it's my body and hen should tell me about what i'm putting in it.

now i'm left here doing my own research on what medication can help intrusive thoughts. probably gonna make another appointment and tell him i don't want to take those and suggest another medicine, and i'm assuming he'll just give it to me. I could also make an appointment with my primary doctor or just wait unitl i move. about the meds, i'm leaning towards zoloft (Sertraline), i took that a few years ago but that was when my depression was really bad, now i'm just trying to fix the anxiety and intrusive thought's because the depression is under control. i think he had originally suggested that but i had told him i had taken it before, i hadn't considered the fact that it might help me now. i'm just really nervous to possibly have an adverse effect.

1013,GAD and Social Anxiety currently at its worst,"Hello guys,

I've had GAD and social anxiety for probably 20 years now.  I used to have depression on and off, strangely, its not affecting me at all. 

For some reason, its currently at its worst - mainly at work.

I had been under a lot of stress which has mostly gone now, but my nervous system and brain don't seem to realise it. 

Over a 6 month period, my flat mate was taken into intensive care.  I looked after his family and him.  It was fine afterwards.  

A week after he went home to finish recovering, my mother was taken in for an emergency op and my uncle died.  My mother has been in and out of hospital since. 

During this time, my workload significantly increased and my boss shouted at me in front of everyone in the office, also calling me to tell me i was embarassing myself and kept going, even after i told him i was burnt out and apologised. Its not happening anymore

I randomly let rip once in the office too - something out of character and i'm ashamed of. Its like i can't be  me, somehow. 

This isn't a sob story, i don't feel sorry for myself, just wondered if you guys had any tips? How do i stop thinking that people think i'm a freak?  Its ruining my brain outside of work, as its constantly on my mind.

Until I came back from sick leave and she had booked a spot to have a 'stern talk', and treated me like I had been behind on certain work and had been keeping that from her.
I argumented that I had never felt like holding something back, because we have been openly treating that subject in that specific time frame since before I started working there and argumented why it did have that specific time frame, different from our other tasks.
She wouldn't have it though, and I thought I would lose my job. 

She even included my soon to be manager, who planned something with me today, just to tell me she didn't agree with the other manager at all, and that she thought my arguments were very logical and legit. She felt sorry the other manager had treated me like this in her last week, but confirmed she would not be operating like that from next week on.
She doesn't know how much those words and confirmations mean to me...

1028,Health Anxiety later in life - head itching,"Up until recently I've been completely horizontal when it comes to health issues. I was firmly in the male camp of ""ignore and it'll probably go away"". Any health issues family or friends had I would often come up with a logical explanation as what it could be (or wasn't), and I would bat well above average in accurate diagnosis. 

Then I hit 40. And my wife had a cancer scare just before Christmas. 

That was the trigger.  And the stress brought about what the GP suspects could be stress induced IBS - pain in my left side that comes and goes. Since then I've been obsessed with googling every little thing. I've convinced myself I've had multiple illnesses. The algorithms have subsequently been bombarding me with suggested stories of people who have months to live after exhibiting similar symptoms. 

Some days I'm.convinced I've got at least 4 different deadly alements. 

Other days my logial brain from my pre 40 self kicks in and tells me I'm being a complete idiot and to look at the evidence or lack there of. 

Everything I look at tells me I'm gonna die or have something horrendous.

For the past 2 weeks I've had on and off horrendous itching in on my scalp. Can't see anything causing it. 

My logical brain says go back to GP. But honestly feel like I'll be dismissed if I verbally throw up a dozen things I fear I have. 

Trying to come up with a point to this post...let's go with the itching. 

The logical part of my brain says it's stress and anxiety causing it. It goes away when I'm distracted (watching a movie or throwing myself into work or going to sleep or has a few drinks.)

1032,Health Anxiety Rant,"Hello, I am not seeking sympathy or anything but I’m feeling very frustrated at myself and unhappy with my current mental state. I (F 21) has struggled with health anxiety for 3 years now. And I know I’m improving from three years ago, but it’s just never enough for me. 

Three years ago, I started experiencing face tingling on the right side while in school and driving (starting a few months after I have crashed my car) This made my senior year really challenging since I started getting headaches, feeling sick to my stomach and have this numbness and tingling sensations on one side. This was enough to ignore for the most part and then fast forward a few months - I had a bad reaction to an edible while staying at my ex boyfriend’s house. I had woken up to shooting chest pain and I was shaking. He told me to go back to bed and then I woke up again to everything spinning and I couldn’t move one side of my body at first. I had to beg him for help and he wouldn’t listen for a bit before finally calling for help and lying to the paramedics about what I had taken. 

After this, I developed very intense health anxiety and OCD - I would constant feel burning sensations and movement in my head that felt like liquid. I also have an intense fear of eye related things (contacts, touching eyeballs, talking about eyeballs etc) and I would have these sensations behind my eyes and I thought they were gonna fall out so I kept touching them and poking around them oh my face, causing my eye lids to almost swell shut. This on top of working a stressful food service job, I had (what I know was an) extreme panic attack at work and fell in the parking lot and  a random person called 911 for me. And they just told me it was a panic attack. 

Over the last few years, I’ve gotten to the out where I feel sensations everyday but it’s minimal. (Back pain, chest tightness, throat tightness, limb and face tingling and numbness, eye floaters etc) usually my first thoughts are a stroke, but I try to snap out it. I’ll raise my arms and smile in mirrors to make sure it’s not drooping. But now, I’m on vacation with my current boyfriend and I would up super anxious today, my stomach was burning and everytime I took a bite of my food, my throat felt tight and my stomach just burned. Then I stressed myself out to bad that I couldn’t do the activity we got tickets for and he’s upset with me because I don’t want to take medication for my OCD and anxiety. 

Note - there’s so much lore and stuff but I feel like I’d type a manifesto or like a whole novel if I explained everything. I don’t know if I need advice or just to feel seen and heard by people who may understand a little better.

I’m not on any medication, and I am going to the doctor next month to talk to her about going on something, because this is no way to live life.

1045,Panic attack only while driving,"
I used to love driving, I used to wait for any errand just so I can go do it myself. I would drive with no destination because driving used to be my comfort thing. During those years I would get dizzy while driving, or feel my throat tight and not be able to swallow but it would go away immediately and I thought nothing about it. In 2022 I started getting panic attacks and would always be dizzy. I did blood tests, MRI’s, eye exams, went to ENT. I literally went to more than 5 doctors and they all said everything was normal and it could be anxiety. By that time I stopped driving and would only go to close places and I wouldn’t get on the highway. Everytime I drive to a place that I’m not used to my throat starts getting tight, I can’t swallow. Which makes me lightheaded and short of breath. Once this happens I get dizzy and I just want to cry. I’ve somewhat been feeling a bit better and I want to start driving like I used to. But as soon as I remember the choking feeling I get I stop wanting to drive. I don’t want to get on medications, and I’ve tried cbt but the sessions are expensive and insurance doesn’t cover it. I need a lot of sessions and almost a year ago I did 4 sessions and stopped going. Any help or tips would be highly appreciated.

1046,Palpitations,"
Hi everyone, 

I hope this message finds you well. 

I’ve been having some concerns about my palpitations that have been ongoing for 4-5 weeks. Randomly, a few weeks ago, I had severe palpitations where it felt as if my heart would stop, which would then trigger panic attacks. It would keep going in a cycle. Even today, I was sitting, and my heart rate skyrocketed randomly after my palpitations. I’ve gotten blood work done, a stress test, and a heart monitor and all came back relatively normal. I’m scared my heart is just going to stop as to how severe they really are, and nothing seems to help me except when I take Ativan to calm me down. Has anybody experienced this with panic attacks? I have a doctor's appointment coming up, and I hope my doctor can give me something to stop these palpitations. I feel so alone and scared. I don’t know what to do or who else to talk to.

At this point I know my body is giving me symptoms to mimic what I know brain tumor symptoms are. I’ve had a headache off and on that I can’t get rid of, nausea, tight jaw, and tingling in one arm. 

I finally went to the ER when the arm tingling started, and got medication for the headache which helped for a day. Well it’s back. My doctor prescribed my cymbalta and I started today and even offered an MRI if it’d ease my mind.

I am not a perfect child! I am as damaged as my sibling and probably worse; I've be taught not to show this side of me but instead pretend to be ""a good religious innocent girl"" that only lives to show people that my parents aren't the bad ones as i am the evidence of their good parenting. 

Thankfully I've outgrown this.. I don't know if i did this consciously or unconsciously cuz something happened to me that caused major disappointment to my parents..

IT WAS HELL!! But since then i left that stupid girl shell and i was able to embrace myself more.. especially in front of my parents..

I evolved but at the same time i developed something weirder and harder which is mirroring..i became terrified of disappointment with other people to the point where i self sabotage.For example: my boss praised me after 3 weeks of work and she was driving me home because i used to stay late with her..the next days i made a major mistake and ended up leaving the job and falling into depression for disappointing her..

My cousin said i was good at doing her sister's nails and instantly my hands started shaking and messed up the whole thing..she was puzzled.

Those are just fewer examples..long story short i am trying to live in the dark and hope that people i interact with don't say something nice about me because i break under the pressure of expectations..I hate this and wish i can fix it but i just don't know how..

1059,Questions on sertraline dosage and when can you see the effects,"Questions on sertraline dosage and when can you see the effects 

A little info abt me, 27F, GAD, agoraphobia and panic disorder. (Honestly the GAD and agoraphobia is due to the panic disorder) On vortioxetine from 2019-2024 did little to NO EFFECT except weight gain (20kg) started sertraline Oct 2024 from 25mg and now 75mg. I feel better but still not independent enough. I will be increasing to 100mg next week. The thing is when will I start to see the effect once I up my dose? Is 100mg a lot? Or I can go up even more? 

I know I can ask my psychiatrist on my next appt but I wanna hear some advices/stories from people who experienced similar things as me. 

My main issue is agoraphobia, or I can say I just can’t be alone in public, I don’t feel safe w myself, will hyperventilate/ start a panic attack when alone. If this is solved everything will be considered under control for me. 

Any advices/suggestions/stories are welcomed!! Much thanks! ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iv2duq/questions_on_sertraline_dosage_and_when_can_you/,CardiologistFickle47,1740173668.0,anxiety

1063,Need advice,"Hello, I am 31f and I am currently going through a rough time with my anxiety so here’s the warning that this post might be long since I’ve never reached out to a community before when it comes to my mental health and I generally just don’t use reddit very often but my anxiety is making me… paranoid? 

I am mainly looking for advice from people that had or have gone thought a similar experience as me and I’m not totally sure if this is the right subreddit as my anxiety stems from my autism and adhd which I was diagnosed with as a kid. I was later diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder, and C-PTSD. I will say now that no I was not treated for any of this as a child. When I became an adult I started to seek treatments and had gone through cognitive behavioral therapy without meds. After that a couple years later I decided it’s time to try medications. For my anxiety I was put on Prozac (20mg) which worked fine, I honestly had no symptoms while taking it, did that treatment for about a year and a half until my doctor decided I was ready to come off it. Was fine for a year or two then started to have anxiety due to my adhd and was prescribed strattera because I don’t really like stimulants. The strattera was fine for the first month until the doctor upped my dosage and I couldn’t sleep for 3 days which was awful. Come to present day I had a panic attack that sent me to the ER which I did follow up with my PCP and we both decided I should be on Prozac again. I was given a referral for a psychiatrist and he prescribed me Prozac (10mg) with strattera (25mg) and the first day I had the most awful reaction to being on both at the same time and so I stopped taking the strattera and only took my prozac yesterday and idk I just felt so on edge like I was very overstimulated and again couldn’t sleep which makes me very agitated and aggressive which makes me very sad because I never had these side effects with prozac before and I feel lost now that the one thing that helped me before is now not helping and having a negative impact on me. I have an appointment next week to deal with that but I was wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar like this and what they used to cope with all of this or any advice is welcome.

1064,How do face your anxiety head on?,"I was diagnosed with GAD. I was doing fine but since 3 days my anxiety spiked up due to anticipatory anxiety.

A month ago, I suffered acidity. Long story short— the doctors in the hospital overreacted and misled me— that triggered my anxiety and I got an attack after about two years. This happened in a different city where I live in a rented flat for work.

I was put off medication last December but after this attack I'm on meds again by the doctor. I'm also on therapy. SSRI takes time so my physical symptoms are not completely gone. I've to return to that city, that flat, this Sunday and the anticipatory anxiety gave me an attack today afternoon. 

I try to reason with my thoughts objectively as my therapist suggested me to do but it is so difficult when it feels like, ""this is it. This is the end. I'll be like this forever. I am a crazy person now.""

1066,"Hello, hope this is the right place.","Hello, M26 here. I don't even know exactly how and where to start. I was never an extroverted person , but I had no difficulty being around lots of people or doing anything in public. At the beginning of 2024 I started developing some kind of fear/anxiety. For some reason whenever I got to a restaurant with my friends to eat , I couldn't eat . I thought it was just a one time issue but it persisted . I can eat outside alone, I can eat in a non crowded restaurant whenever I am just with myself or anywhere else but when I am with people , I just can't get the food down my throat. Even if its just a little piece of fries or anything, I can't eat with my friends around.

Another issue also appeared , sometimes when I am grocery shopping I feel shortness of breath and I feel mild heart pain , like im in some kinda fight or flight mode even tho there is no danger anywhere. For a while I thought this second issue was caused by consuming lots of caffeine , when I stopped drinking coffee completely, this issue subsided but its not 100% gone and some days it still appears.

I have no idea what caused this but it makes me feel bad that I can not have a good time with my friends and eating together because they think I don't wanna eat with them but I honestly just can't and I have no idea what triggered this for me.

I have made huge progress since then, I can go out grocery shopping, take the bus and even the subway (I'm still kind of nervous but it's manageable) now this week I had my first in-person therapy session, took the subway to go to a shopping centre with my boyfriend, then took the subway alone quite a bit further just to practice (I did it without getting out, but I was struggling quite a bit sometime) I have to take my theoretical drivers license test on Tuesday or else my time runs out (I wasn't able to do the test and much driving due to my bad mental health ) then the family I was babysitting for a year ago texted me and asked if I had capacity and I said yes because the situation with the driver license and the long subway journey on my own was after that and I had no idea what was coming .today my boyfriend came over and out of nothing I started bawling the minute we started cuddling. I couldn't even say why at first, but I guess it was just too much this week. now the kind of problem is that I struggle with psychosomatic nausea, which flared up quite a bit today. I'm also insanely scared of getting sick so there's that(I never actually vomited from anxiety. I just gagged and dry heaved lollz) 

now the ""problem"" is that I have to get up early tomorrow to meet someone at a train station 40 minutes away. I have to take two different subways and then find this person in a large mall. My boyfriend will accompany me but due to me being already nervous today, I just feel so stressed out and defeated. He did offered that he could meet this person tomorrow so I wouldn't have to drive there, but I really do want to go myself just to have some more exposure and training.

Food like bread or ground turkey, vegetables. I don't choke on the food, nor do aspirate. Sometimes i have to swallow twice or 3 times, is that normal. Having a hyperawaness of food when I eat. I tried to explain this sensation to my wife but she doesn't understand. I'm not really struggling. I'm able to chugg a water bottle. I can eat different foods and nothing truly gets stuck. I can feel some food sticking. My brain jumped to ALS. I start googling that. Not a good idea. I can definitely rule it out but sometimes that random fear keeps popping up.

1072,"For all the people that suffer anxiety, search for the book ""Hope and Help for your Nerves"" from claire weekes","You can also just type ""claire weekes"" in youtube. 

She explains how there is 2 types of fear. One is the fear (or body sensations) that your body gives and you can't control (trembling, dizziness, hot flushes, tingling, heart racing etc)  and the second fear is the fearing of the first fear. The second fear just amplifies the first fear (thats how 100% of my panic attacks arised). her approach is, to accept the first fear and just see it as your friend, because it actually is. All that body sensations like heart palpitations, dizziness, trembling, etc are just sensations that your brain gives you to make you alert because your sympathetic nervous system is sensitized due to a long run of stress or anxiety or both. Those symptoms are there to put you in an alarming state because that was a benefit in the early stages of mankind where dangerous animals and other forces of nature were present. to ""desensitize"" it, you have to allow and accept your symptoms and don't fear them ( yeah I know it seems easier said than done) but it is the only solution. What is the benefit of not accepting your anxiety ? What is the benefit of fighting against your anxiety? It just will get more worse and create harder or new symptoms, so accepting it, is the only solution. 

Now there comes something very interesting for me, because I've tried this and I had success within few days, I just had no symptoms but I got a setback at one evening where the anxiety came back. But those setbacks are totally natural because my brain recognized that im not anymore tense and at stress about my symptoms, but my brain remembers that I had for a very long time anxiety about it and it thinks that it is there for one good reason, and that is ""surviving in the wilderness"". My brain thinks now ""what are you doing? you are at constant anxiety because there are many animals that may want to kill you and now you are relaxed and accepting it?"" Now its time where my brain starts making symptoms (first fear) to tell me that I must be alarmed to fight or flight. But as long as I accept the first fear and avoid therefore the second fear, my brain will learn that there is no danger anymore and will get used to the new pattern and signal it to relax. 

Our brain is made to react to physical threats which is in this modern world more like a disadavantage because today we have more psychological threats like ""what will happen if my boss fires me? will I ever find a girlfriend if im ugly? What if I don't get good grades at school?

I hope to get my point through here, im not that good of a writer and english is not my native language

However, every time I have to go get my car worked on I start freaking out every time. I’ll sit in a parking lot across from the place for about thirty minutes to an hour and try to hype myself up. Today I did just that and it didn’t work so I went to go get a treat to see if that would help entice me and it did work.

I just wish I could get someone else to do it for me. My inspection is way past due and I really need an oil change but these places just flare up my anxiety and make me hate myself for it.

1082,My girlfriend's anxiety is putting me at my breaking point,"I'm in some dire need of advice here. 

The short version is this, I've (M27) been dating my girlfriend (F28) for about four months now. We generally have a really great time together, and I'd like to think there's a bright future for us.

My girlfriend has anxiety. It's usually general / non-specific, but she has a particular focus on her appearance. I think she's beautiful, by any standard, and she's certainly the most beautiful woman I've ever dated. I try to boost her self-esteem by sprinkling in little reminders of this fact, and she always seems to appreciate them in the moment.

The problem is, she will sometimes enter into these hours-to-days long spirals about her appearance. She'll tell me she feels ugly, that I deserve to be with someone prettier, etc. 

When this happens, my life basically has to to stop. If I had plans with friends, they're cancelled. If my parents were coming to visit, I have to invent some excuse to ward them off. If work calls, I have a stomach bug. Because my girlfriend will be in her room, crying her eyes out, and I'm expected to be there the entire time trying to comfort her. And if she thinks something else is taking priority in any way, it makes things worse.

She's made it clear to me that when this happens, she needs me to tell her affirmative things. That I love her, that I won't leave her, that she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. And at first, I was ok with this. I felt like I was doing what any loving/supporting partner would do. And I figured if I just did this long enough, she'd internalize the things I was saying and these sessions would become less frequent and less bad.

But that's not happening. If anything, they're happening more often. And if I don't respond exactly the way my girlfriend expects/wants/needs (and these 'needs' can be very specific, and she doesn't want to 'tell me what to do' because that 'ruins the meaning') she'll get angry with me, and question everything about our relationship.

I'm starting to feel like I'm my girlfriend's therapist or emotional support blanket. And I'm really torn on the reactions I'm having. On the one hand I feel bad, like I'm not a good enough partner because I can't make this stop. But on the other hand, I'm starting to resent the way she treats me and the way I'm expected to drop everything to soothe her. It's starting to feel like, after months of telling her I think she's beautiful, she's basically calling me a 'liar' by needing me to repeat it so often.

1085,Help me!,"I don’t know what to do. I want to die, but I can’t do it because of my family.

You might have read stories about middle-class families, but have you ever read about lower-class families? I have written my story as shortly as I can.

My family consists of my brother, mother, younger brother (who is in 10th grade), and sister who is about to complete +2. I am 21 years old, and my elder brother is 23. I work as a videographer in a advertising company. I am a fresher, and my salary is 12k Indian money (140$)

My brother went to the Gulf as a student when he was 20. he spent all his earnings and sent back only enough to cover the family’s expenses.

My father (in my life mostly hated person) left us seven years ago (not because he passed away, but because he abandoned us). Since then, our family’s situation has worsened. My family and I have had to endure more than we could handle. While everyone else in the family owns their own house, we are the only ones still living in a run-down house that looks like it could collapse at any time. It would probably top the list of the worst houses in our hometown.

My father never provided us with what we needed. He didn’t buy us a house. He didn’t give us a proper education. My brother and I only completed +2. Although I went to college, I had to drop out after three months because financial struggles became unbearable. After that, I started working, saved some money, and studied videography( my passion). My elder brother completed +2 but couldn’t continue his studies due to financial difficulties. He had to work different jobs just to survive.

If you ask me about my biggest dream in life, I would say it is to have a small house for my family to live in. My mother always says, “I just want to live in my own house before I die.” She has suffered so much since birth—always struggling, always in poverty, never getting a chance to live a peaceful life.

I had two relationships in the past, but when they heard my story, they left me. They are right because no point in being with someone from such a poor family.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t have a house. My sister is about to complete +2 and is growing up. My younger brother will be in +1 next year. I feel like I’m going crazy. Even though my salary is 12k, after EMI and loan repayments, my expenses come to 20K. And if I add the loans we had to take just for household expenses, the total debt is overwhelming.

Iam Thinking about all this, I feel mentally exhausted. How can i start from zero?

Litterally iam living for my family . For my mom 🤍

Woke up in Spain at 2am with intense lower left abdominal pain. I vomit because that pain and got chills and got dehydrated because of vomiting so much because of pain. Hospital was closed somehow so next day went home and went to doc asap who just wrote up antibiotics. This was like 6 months ago. The pain what i felt was CONSTANT AND NON STOP. Like someone stabbing you with a knife. Now i got pain 4-6 hr/day because of this. During the constant pain circle developed neck/tongue/jaw/ear pain. Well this pain is also constant and i wake up with this pain and sleep with it. Nothing works, nothing helps. 

Went to doctors (maybe 20+ diff ones like ENTs, neurologists, ER, GI, urologists, etc) and the found nothing.

I’ve been feeling very nauseous, stomach pains, generally more anxious, hard time staying asleep and a few panic attacks throughout this time. I started having crippling anxiety about 2 months ago and I’ve never been overly anxious before, but it got to a point where any time I left my house, I was getting panicky. 

Are these side effects normal or should I try and get off Zoloft and pick up something new? I’m losing hope everyday that passes and it feels like I’ll never get my life back. Sometimes I’ll get this deep sadness that feels like my world is ending and I’m in agonizing pain.

1093,I need a vent out.,"Hi. Throwaway account.

17M. Lives in a nice place,, supportive parents, good food, good life.

I am a very sensitive person. Sensitive to feelings, sensitive to impolite gestures, sensitive to love, sensitive to critisism, sensitive to life. I care for little things in life, admire genuinely nice people and love someone with extra passion the moment they show intrest in me(No I don't have nor have had a girlfriend for those who think I'm horny rn)

And boys, as far as the stereotype goes, are not sensitive. They are tough, with no feelings, living up to societal expectations. Thence, my life has mostly comprised of being a misfit. 

Few friends, many of who are snakes, a sibling you understands me but lives away and is dealing with her own share of problems. A toxic  parent who harmed the other, me and my sister so much mentally the effects engraved on my character. 
- High anxiety when confronted or abandoned
- Constant Overthinker
- Need constant support and love
- Hates not living up to what my loved ones expect off of me. 
- Academically good, but burnt out honestly 

My future remains uncertain, will I get a good college? Will I land a good job? Will the world be habitable throughout the duration of my life? What if my friend decides to abandon me? What if I'm all alone? What if my parent dies? What if something sudden happens? What if I fall? What if I fail?

I ruminate, I dwell. I do vent out, infact quite a lot so much so I feel guilty doing it so many times.  But I don't feel content. 

Highly introverted but gets excited around people I know. I am a red flag, toxic guy with nothing known as sanity, just trying to pass life on every single day. A new failure every day- even I was born out of a failed contraception lol. 

I seriously love and loathe myself the same time idk how. Know my standards, know how to stand up(even tho I don't), know how to code, how to make conlangs, good at chemistry, looks handsome, tall and all but wtf is wrong with me all in all??

If you've read this far, I appreciate you. Thank you.
Please don't cancel me I can't take it.

Warm greetings.

1095,"Anxiety coming back, is this a reason to worry?","Hello, hope y'all doing well.

A had a major panic attack last year and got diagnosed with GAD and DPDR. Long story short, i've been on paxil 30g for four months now after trying a lot of meds. 

Not everything was smooth sailing since but I guess it was still ok-ish. Some DPDR, some lingering anxiety but no panic attack or paniful moments. 

Since a week I've been feeling weird. On the plus side, I feel like my DPDR is finally diminishing, I feel more grounded and physically ""here"", on the minus side, my anxiety is coming back full force like, knotted stomach bad or ""I don't feel like I can get up right now"" bad. 

There are some reasons that might explain it (my birthday is coming up and i always throw a bug party which require a lot of organisation, i've been trying to lose weight and to fight a cafeine addiction...) but I still feel that it's weird that my anxiety has been coming back so ""physically"" I guess, before, it was more a light-headed feeling and constant dread. 

Did this happen to anymore in their recovery process? Should I contact my psych?

1096,Panic attack,"Never mix anti-depressants and marijuana. I’m 16 and stupid for abusing both of them at the same time, but it sent me into a severe panic attack and now I feel the need to warn people or share my experience to further understand it myself.

I’m not 100% sure it was a panic attack, I’m honestly still really scared and in shock by what happened and the way I was feeling then. ..So on Sunday me and my friend were taking her prescription meds (Zoloft, and toprimate) and then smoking after we took them. We had been doing this for the previous three days and while some symptoms were bad most of the time the ”high” felt great. Skip to about 2 in the morning, i remember it being so insanely sudden. I was thinking about everything, life, consciousness, how I came to be, how I was alone on this plane of a universe. It sent me into a severe anxious panic, my vision was weird, I just remember standing up and running upstairs to wake my mom. I remember when I was going up the steps it felt like I wasn’t moving at all, even though I had to of been. I woke my mom, slept by her side that night, and she then took me to the Emergency room the following day. For the first three days of recovery I was so confused and almost convinced myself I was psychotic.

The main symptoms, the ONE i distinctly remember was I couldn’t, and still struggle, to feel “zoned in”. Ever sinced it has happened, I feel so zoned out. I’ve been spending a lot of time recovering with my mom, she really helps me. The doctors said I was fine, just needed to drink water and flush my system. 

It has almost been a week, the daily struggles are the flashbacks and the anxious feelings in my stomach and mind, and my inability to find my appetite. i’ve literally lost 14 pounds. I think after this I might go to therapy, lol. I’m now deathly scared of meds like antidepressants and anxiety pills but what if I might need them?

1097,Hear me out please. Need to vent.,"This is going to be a long post so bare with me. And thankyou in advance. 
So, Im 27(m). Ever since I was a kid I felt anxiety but never figured out what it was. Everyday issues would make my heart sink and pound until the problem resolved. But, after that I felt fine. So, never gave any attention to it. But this carried on throughout the years. 
2 years back an event occured. So, my sister and her bf at the time had a 7 year long relation. They had some complications and I was dragged into it. I was the middle man listening to boths side while they fought and argued. This went on a little over a month. This caused severe anxiety for me. I feel very uncomfortable with confrontations and fights around me. My anxiety got to a point where I could not eat, nor sleep nor think. I would constantly overthink and feel my heart pounding out of my chest. This went on for about 4-6 weeks. Till their issues sorted out. I guess that incident is what broke the wall to my anxiety finally. Things settled down with them they got engaged a while after and now are married and happy. 
As for me that entire period shifted my mental health. I was always anxious. But, I think that period pushed me over the edge. A few months after they got engaged and everything was fine in our lives. I started getting anxiety again. I started feeling numb with my emotions and that really freaked me out. This was around the time that my relationship with my gf became very serious. I wanted to propose. But, with my anxiety as i said I started feeling numb emotionally. And i felt emotionally numb towards her aswell. I felt horrible about this and it made things worse for me. I communicated this to her and she was very understanding and supportive throughout. We have been engaged for about a year now. But at the time feeling numb towards her just made me overthink too much. This led to me feeling sick and I had my first panic attack at the time. It was horrible. And then I continued to have panic attacks. I then decided to seek professional help and was put on medications and was told various exercises to cope with my anxiety. The treatment helped. 
Currently after all that I'm at a stage where I can't deal with issues anymore. The moment something goes wrong I start to feel like I'm sicking again. My sister and her husband's relation is now a trigger for me. Anytime they have an argument and my sister would discuss it with me I would feel my heart sink and it felt like the world is about to end. Even though it's just a normal argument couples tend to have and she's just talking about it. I have a good relation with them sometimes they videocall me together randomly and I get insanely anxious just looking at the call over what went wrong?
 Why are they calling me? Is everything fine?. Where infact when I pick up everything turns out to be normal.

I have alot on my plate right now. Im planning for my masters abroad where my fiance is, I have a wedding to plan. Both those things have to be financed by me and that's part of my overthinking. I have some pre req exams to give before my masters. All this has caused my anxiety to come back. And I just got back on my treatment. About 2 days ago I had a session again. And my psych told me I should have never stopped as my issue is not just a phase. Its something I have to deal with in the long term. I was fine for the past few months so I stopped. 
I hate feeling this way. I hate being this way. I hate anxiety. It's horrible. 
I need to know how do I cope with these stupid triggers? How do I get to a point where I can face a problem without overthinking about it so much that it makes it impossible to sleep. How do I stop getting triggered when I see a normal call from my sister and her husband. What are some ways that helped people here control there thoughts?

1099,PLEASE help. Especially if you struggle with panic disorder,"This might be long but I need advice from anybody willing to give it. I feel so hopeless. I am a 19yr old female sophomore in college. Growing up and all of high school I never had anxiety or depression a day in my life until the middle of senior year. I had my first ever panic attack February 2023 and had a few more spread out throughout a few months. I don't know if it is related but two months before that I got into a car accident, and although I physically was fine, it realllyyyyy shook me up. At the end of the school year I went to college orientation and that morning I woke up perfectly normal in the hotel, made it to the opening speech in this big ballroom full of people - and suddenly everything started spinning and I freaked the fuck out. And that day leading into the summer it kind of never stopped. Honestly, I haven't felt normal honestly since that day.. almost 2 years later. I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder following this by my psychiatrist. That summer going into college I was literally dying - couldn't hangout with my friends, go to work, be outside. In order to do anything I had to take a Xanax but even then I didn't feel fully normal. I literally just laid in bed all the time obsessing over how I felt ""sick"". I found myself in the hospital that summer 4 times because of constant dizziness/lightheadedness, sensitivity to light, nausea, fast heart rate, shortness of breath, feeling ""off balance"", brain fog.. the list goes on but it was those same recurring symptoms literally everyday. Everytime they sent me home and told me I was fine. Fast forward to the start of college I'm still experiencing these symptoms but not as debilitating - I was able to go to class and hang out with friends. I rarely ever went out and the times that I did I would have a panic attack there and feel like I had to leave or else I would like pass out or something. I would feel so off and dizzy at bars. Football games made me feel the same way too. Even times in lecture halls. That first semester was rough but I think being forced around so many people and never being alone in my dorm helped me a lot. After winter break, second semester(start of 2024), I was like a totally different person. I went out a bunch with my friends, went to all my classes - it's like all those symptoms legit went away. I still had anxiety, but I could function like a normal person and have fun which was something I wasn't able to do for a long time. All of 2024 was amazing, the summer, and first semester of sophomore year. My anxiety was finally getting better. Fast forward again January 2025 literally out of NOWHERE I woke up one random day and it's like all those symptoms came back. And they're still here. Idk if this is related but I had a major depressive episode at the end of 2024 due to my living situation. I don't know what to do I've been to the doctor multiple times again, lungs seem fine, bloodwork is good, everything seems fine. I haven't had a non-anxious thought in over a month. I think now I'm depressed from it too. I haven't been to class in weeks and just want to sleep all day. I can't even exercise without feeling like I'm going to pass out from walking on a treadmill. Am I making myself sick? Am I actually sick and this isn't anxiety? Please someone help because the doctors don't care and those close to me don't understand.

1109,Does this seem like anxiety!,"Hey guys, I don’t really know where to start but basically Ive had a few health scares recently, mainly just me being a hypochondriac. But over the last few months I believe I’ve been having anxiety attacks, which I’ve never had in my life since recently. I’ve always been an anxious person but have never experienced something like this in my life. Do to all the overthinking and searching up symptoms and stuff I’ve been having these spells/bouts and I wanted to see if y’all though this is anxiety, and if it is how I should go about it. It usually starts as something that surprises me or gives me like a split second wave of anxiety or nervousness, even something small like thinking about something philosophical that freaks me out or  anything that causes a quick spike in adrenaline. Then after that I get this weird light feeling spread through my chest and stomach, sometimes a hot flash and I become aware of my heartbeat and it feels like my chest or throat swell up almost, like I can breath normally but my body isn’t processing any oxygen. I feel super weak and fatigued/shaky/muscle spasms, and it’s almost like my vision zooms out (like my fov is higher than usual)and their are these halos around things, especially repeating patterns, and I get this feeling of vertigo, I feel like I lose touch with reality, if I stare at something I kind of get stuck in my mind, thinking faster than I can even comprehend what i’m thinking. But the weirdest is part is recently I’ve had these happen with apparently no trigger, I’ll just feel extremely brain foggy, can concentrate, and I get the same vertigo zoomed out feeling with the weird vision and halos. I really haven’t been the same sense, and when I have those spells I literally feel like i’m going crazy until it wears off.

Also in the past I was scared of developing a psychosis ect., I do know these kind of fears are pretty common with anxiety, but is it more of some kind of ocd? Fear of bibolar is more common fear atm, I think it has something to do with the fact that I have two people really close to me with this diagnosis. I am constantly hyper aware of my mood and if I feel a tinyest bit of energy and exitement I go into a spiral.

1125,I’m afraid of the nothingness that comes after death,"I'm 18 and I've always struggled with the fear of death. Im slightly concerned about the process of dying but I'm mainly concerned about what happens after death, since I'm not religious I don't really believe in an afterlife I feel like after we die we will experience nothingness. Whenever I bring up these troubles to friends and family I always get told that it’s part of life and I need to accept it....but how. I like my life right now I want to wake up everyday to do the thing I enjoy, to see my family, to go out with friends, I don't want to give these up. Some people say just try to remember what ur life was like before you were born and that’s what death would feel like but that’s thing I’m afraid of. I know at the time I didn’t feel anything but now that I have a consciousness and have a life I don’t want it to end. I wish I will be able to retain the memories I have after I die or see my family and friends. This fear started when I was around 7 but I got over it when I heard about cryogenics so I thought I would be able to live forever with that but after doing more research I realized this was mostly pseudoscience so the fear came back and stuck with me since. I’ve also recently done quick research about transferring your consciousness into a computer but that isn’t possible yet and I’m worried it wouldnt be possible in my lifetime. Is there anyway to over come this fear? How does everyone else just accept it? I feel like the only way I can overcome it is reassurance that death won’t happen or that there’s an alternative that actually works.

Edit: wow I didn't expect so many comments. I wrote this at 2am and just wanted to share my thoughts during that moment of fear.

1132,"Teasing myself with my own death anxiety, please help!","TLDR: My death anxiety has gotten worse the past week. I almost convince myself to have panic attacks. I don’t know why and don’t know how to stop these thoughts. 

Hi all! I (23M) have had a “fear” of death my whole life that I think is rooted in my religious upbringing as well as my own personal logic. I do not know what I believe, but I know my anxiety is based on the idea of “eternity”; what that is, how that feels, can I feel it, so on. 

I started taking medication in high school and have been taking it since, but recently (last year) switched from Zoloft to Lexapro. 

My anxiety does not affect me during the day, literally at all. It is rooted to the night time and when I am in bed. I have never had an anxiety attack with other people present or outside of my bed. I can identify this as a type of trigger for me. I used to believe it was my childhood bedroom, but as I grew older and moved out, it followed me. 

While being clean of an attack for almost 3-4 months, about 5 days ago I had a random attack while trying to fall asleep. In a matter of seconds and after a singular thought, I shot out of my bed and could not breathe. In about 15 seconds, it was over. Every night since then, the same thing has happened. What feels different about these attacks though, is that they start with me almost “teasing” myself into having an attack. 

For example, I’ll have the thoughts: 

“Better not think about death” 
or 
“Hmm do you think you could think about eternity and not have a panic attack?” 

And what ensues is a panic attack. 


I do not know why this is happening at such an extent, and I am starting to get worried that my anxiety is getting worse. Has anyone ever felt this way before? That your anxiety literally makes you play with your own peace of mind?

The second one was worse, lasted 30 minutes, and I thought I was having a stroke. The third was the worst—I was convinced I was dying of a heart attack. Since then, my anxiety has been out of control.

At first, I thought something was wrong with my brain, then my heart, then my lungs. Now I keep worrying I have a hiatal hernia, even though I haven’t been diagnosed. I’ve lost 8 kg in just two months, and I look like a zombie.

The biggest problem? I have an important boxing match in April and an important exam coming up, but I haven’t been able to train or study. I feel like my heart will ""get tired,"" or if I lift weights, I’ll get a hernia. Every time I get anxious, I feel like puking, and I can’t eat or train without severe anxiety.

Doctors have checked my blood pressure, oxygen levels, and heart rate—they say everything is fine and that acidity triggered my panic attack. But I haven’t done an ECG, endoscopy, or anything else, so my mind keeps racing.

My parents and coach keep telling me I’m healthy, but my anxiety won’t let me believe it. I just turned 22, and I need serious help. I’ve lost all my confidence, and I just want to feel normal again.

Has anyone been through this? How do I get back to training and studying without fear?

I’d appreciate any suggestions/Advice 🙏🏽

1144,Terrified for tooth extraction tomorrow,"Tomorrow's the day when I get 4 of my teeth extracted, and I have been absolutely terrified. I don't know what to do, and it feels like my face is about to be ruined. My teeth ended up decaying at an early age due to not having proper dental care enforced, being given too many sweets as a kid, bad genetics (everyone else in my family has gotten several teeth extracted), being lazy, and having a fear of dentists due to a bad experience, and I just feel so pathetic for having to get my teeth extracted at 15. I would rather literally anything else than have my teeth taken away, but I don't have a choice. I'm also too young to get implants, so I don't have a choice but to walk around with several gaps in my teeth. I'm also terrified of my face being sunken or my teeth shifting; I really don't want my missing teeth to be noticeable at all. My friends have told me I generally barely open my mouth when I speak (probably because I've always been self-conscious about how poor my dental health is), so I'm not extremely worried about people noticing the gaps, but they would definitely notice my face being sunken in. It terrifies me.

I'm also really worried about being put under anesthesia. I have really bad health anxiety, and it's my first time being put under, so I'm terrified about the possibility of something going wrong. I have a million what-ifs ringing through my head. What if I have an unexpected reaction to the drugs and I die from it? What if I wake up during the surgery but I'm unable to move or see so I just have to sit there while feeling everything they're doing to me (which has happened to people, by the way)? What if they mess up the surgery and one of my teeth falls down my throat and I choke on it and die? What if I vomit while under anesthesia and they can't wake me up and I choke to death? Even though I'm far more terrified of not waking up, waking up without 4 of my teeth also scares me half to death. I'm also afraid of embarrassing myself while I'm still under the effects of the drugs. My brother is definitely the type of person to record me while I'm loopy and make fun of me for it. We share a room, too, so he'll definitely see me. Also, the drugs will be delivered via a needle in my arm, and both my brother and his girlfriend have been to the doctor recently and have gotten muscle-deep bruises from having a needle in their arm. Every aspect of this is terrifying to me.

I recently visited my gp to get access to a mental health plan (gives Australian citizen 10 reduced phychology appointments yearly) when I was speaking with my doctor she mentioned that I had received a plan last year and asked me why I needed another again this year. She continued to tell me that not every problem can be resolved by therapy and at some point I will need to be satisfied with the progress I have made. She spend another 10 minutes talking me out of seeing my phychology when I have never spoken with her about my mental health issues. She had student doctor sitting in on the appointment and I felt humiliated. It had been a really big struggle of mine in the past as I have had my own mother tell me I am worth less because I am ""broken"" and need to see a phychologist. I don't know what to do.

But I never really paid attention to it, I'd had nightmares where the world ended then wake up happy because it was just a nightmare. But recently, with the world entering in such a tense and unknown socio-economic-geographical atmosphere, these fears have been sky rocketing.

Im just awaiting for a loud alarm in my phone in any moment and seeing the sky turn red as a explosion wave hits me, or having no money to buy food, or getting bombed, or the world collapsing bc of our waste, or a meteor hitting us a killing us all.

These fears have made me dig a lot (which i know does not help at all) and find out abt asteroid 2024 which is keeping a hold of me just after i got over the fear of a WWIII approaching across the corner, I don't want to go in lunatic mode thinking that NASA does not tell us every single detail and purposely makes the threat seem less so society does not collapse.

And what's worse is that I feel, when I finally get over these fears and start enjoying life again (this past month i have not been able to enjoy anything, everything makes me sad and i feel all it's worthless) it will all go down at the same time and I will have the most terrifying death ever.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iunl76/growing_anxiety_and_paralizying_fear_over_looming/,shigsssss,1740132579.0,anxiety

1162,What to expect at a first doctors appointment if I bring up my anxiety makes it hard to make appointments/phone calls/etc - will anxiety be a priority for them to get under control before doing anything else?,"I debated on what subreddit to post this on, however because my questions primarily revolve around anxiety and a difficulty making appointments and such, I figure here would be the best?

Okay, so, I haven't had a doctor in YEARS.  I'm on a waitlist, I'm in Canada in a small town so it's taking awhileeee. However I like to be prepared... lol so when I do get a doctor, I know what to maybe expect.

So my anxiety makes it hard for me to actually like... Make phone calls/talk on the phone - I have to get my mom to actually call whatever initially and then I can take the phone from her and actually continue the conversation myself but... Kinda embarrassing that she still has to start calls for me, but I guess the fact I can take the phone, talk/explain/finish the conversations is... slight. slight. progress.  
It makes me struggle to make appointments. Go to appointments. I walk into a hospital/doctors office and even if I'm not the one being seen - PANIC. Blood pressure spiked. heart rate up.  
Which you know, you gotta do all that when you have a doctor. Especially after not having one for years, I'd imagine they'd want to get up to date on everything like blood work and such so... lots of appointments, lots of medical buildings, referrals to other places potentially?

So at the first appointment, if I express how my anxiety will make it hard for me to make/go to more appointments/etc and I think it's important to try and get control of that first so I can actually go to appointments, make calls, etc and hopefully not be sitting there, frozen, panicking the whole time lol... What will they do?  
Will they tell me to suck it up and just deal with it. Will they put me on medication right then. Refer me to a therapist or something. I know SSRI's take weeks to start working and need monitoring? so would they prescribe that and wait for that to start working before making more appointments for other things, or would they possibly prescribe a small amount of some sort of fast acting anti anxiety pill to take as needed(which would be before appointments and before phone calls and appointments I think) until I get through all the initial appointments and then start me on a ssri possibly(I've taken ativan in the past, never an amount prescribed but given one pill multiple times at a hospital when I went for panic attacks in the past so I know those do work, however I also heard doctors don't like prescribing those) or... I just kinda want to know what might happen/what to expect. I know it depends on the doctor. But... Any personal experiences/guesses will help even though it's probably a long time away before I get a doctor, ugh, but hopefully it happens soon.

But after my water starts getting warm, I plop them in and I do about 7-8 minutes (hard boil is to much for me I like the runny yolk). I make my sandwiches and plop them on a warm pan and yay not long after sandwiches were put in pan my egg timer goes off. So I start peeling my eggs. While sandwiches finish, yes I cooled the eggs off first. My eggs wanted to fall apart when I was peeling which was already starting to over stimulate me. I put them down to breathe so I check my sandwich  still not as toasted as I want ok cool I let them sit a bit more.

1170,Feel like I don’t know how to go back to the Dr,"It's been forever since I have been to the doctor. Probably 7 years or so. I am hitting 50 next year and want to start feeling better now before I hit that milestone. Perimenopause is starting and it's no joke. I was medical support. 
It started off with failing to make follow up yearly appointments and time just passed by. I've got a family so I always put myself on the back burner and told myself I'd get to it. It's been 7 years. And now I feel so stupid for not taking care of myself. My old doctor retired during the pandemic. I have found a few doctors that I want to consider. 
How do I get the courage to make the appointment? 
How do I explain that I truly want to get back into taking care of myself without looking like a fool. 
Will the doctor judge me? Make me feel bad for it? I feel like I am going to start crying while I try to explain myself.

I so badly want to start but don't know how to get out of my own way. Just the thought of setting an appointment makes me very anxious. ",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iufniw/feel_like_i_dont_know_how_to_go_back_to_the_dr/,Curious_Argument9413,1740103358.0,anxiety

1172,Was my intense anxiety when drunk caused by Zoloft?,"Was my insane anxiety when drunk caused by taking a Zoloft tablet?

So I’m 18 and just got prescribed Zoloft for social anxiety and generalised anxiety. And other symptoms. The social anxiety is very bad and my life is intrusive thoughts most days so I’m glad I did. Past 2 weeks my anxiety has gotten really bad and I’ve been drinking a lot. Like I’m talking every single day getting drunk without fail. Other day i drunk a 0.7L of vodka through out the day. One half in the early day one half after the gym.And nowadays it’s usually the only thing that makes me feel normal. And I almost never get anxious on it and if I do it’s mild. But for the first time ever in my lifee.I took a 25mg Zoloft tablet after reading it can take multiple months to kick. I was drunk at that point. And was having a good time watching youtube in my room.and when I took it I got insanely anxious.  Felt genuinely horrible like I wanted to die.which never happens to me when I drink . I ended up riding my ebike to the store for more alcohol. It was 0:30 at that point.and when I was loooking at the ciders I had genuine blurry ass vision. Like genuinely had a hard time reading the label. Then I rode to get food and also some cocktails to chug I was insanely anxious the whole time. Type of anxiety you would have if someone was chasing you down. Then I got food. And was gonna go gym to calm me down. Which I’m glad I didint cause I was insanely drunk lmao.but then I rode back. Was going nearly 50khm per hour while swerving traffic so I’m glad there was no cars on the road. But does anyone know if this was caused by Zoloft.?Should I continue taking it?

1175,Starting to wonder if it’s actually anxiety…,"I’ve been experiencing dull aching chest pain for years, and have tried close to ten different anxiety medications with no significant improvement. 

I have been operating under the assumption that the chest pain is anxiety-related, as I had previously ruled out cardiological issues, but everything I read indicates that anxiety chest pain is typically an acute sensation that lasts for minutes or hours, as opposed to all day, which is what I experience.

Furthermore, for me, there are usually no discernible triggers. I don’t feel actively anxious or stressed, my pulse and breathing are normal, etc., yet my chest just aches, so I am starting to question whether this is truly anxiety after all, or perhaps something neuropathic.

Has anyone else experienced this type of chest pain/been able to get some relief?

1177,Heart palpitations ruining my life,"I first got heart palpitations around summer 2023 when I was 20. I would get them every so often maybe if I drank too much the night before. Gradually it’s gotten worse, I had to completely cut things like coffee and then alcohol out of my life, getting dizzy as soon as I drank them. I was given propanol and it worked for a while but all of a sudden one day last month it completely stopped working, when I went to the doctors about this she decided I should stop taking it all together as she believed it was slowing my heart down too much. My heart palpitations have gotten so bad I can’t even work out for 15 minutes anymore, I dread waking up every day, I cannot sleep at night I constantly feel dizzy, sick and my chest gives me so much anxiety. I have been checked for a chest x ray, I wore an ECG for 72 hours and all have came back clear, been up to A and E constantly with no problems. I’ve been to doctors/hospital over 20 times in the past year or so about this and have made absolutely no improvement, they seem completely at a loss. I don’t know what to do anymore I have cut everything out of my life that could be causing these and now the propanol has been taken off me I’m scared I will feel like this everyday for the rest of my life. I went to therapy when I was younger (unrelated to the palpitations, my dad passed away) so I know a lot of breathing techniques and they don’t really help at all.

Their advice is if things are getting to severe it’s impacting my ability to do things day to day, medication is a consideration to weigh. Otherwise, some amount is normal consider the real impact things could have.

But it has me thinking about how much  you’re supposed to be able to normally handle vs. when should you be seeking additional help (like medications)?

1182,"Health Anxiety, Chest Pains, Twitching, just writing it all out","Hello everyone! I've tried to keep it structured, it's a lot. Just wanted to write it all out.

I (m/29) have been struggeling with health anxiety, heart palpatitions and chest pain for 4 years now, chest pain just became more prevelant in the last feww months though. Nonetheless I'm really just tired of not understanding what's going on with this body so I'm writing this to see how many other people maybe struggle with the same and hopefully some of you also don't feel so alone with your struggles when you read this.

I share the classic story with many others that my heart is in great shape and everything is fine. My last ultrascan showed that there's a tiny bit of liquid surrouding my heart (if I remember correctly) but my doc had to tripple check to even notice it's there and assured me that it can't be the cause of my problems. There's also thankfully no one my family with heart problems.

My timeline with anxiety and health anxiety is:

The hypochondria probably started thanks to watching Doctor House once when I was 11. I became pretty good at convincing myself to have whatever they were having in the hospital show I was watching. I was also good at focusing on every small sensation I had and interpret it as dangerous.

I then just had nothing happening for probably 10 years until 2018-19 arrived and I was weighing 48 kilograms while being 169m. I knew I was thin but one day while eating I just became really nervous all of a sudden, lost all appetite and just couldn't continue eating. From there on out I actually got scared of eating and lost my enjoyment of it. I was a full time YouTuber and Streamer back then, so attaching my self-worth to everything I put out didn't help with the anxiety at all and I became a bit of a wreck.

I thankfully got over the eating-anxiety by visiting Japan once and seeing how many people were outside living normaly while looking even thinner then I was. Setting myself the goal to just finish every meal I was eating, no matter how long it took also helped with overcoming that fear.

So how's it going in 2025?

I try to do yoga everyday, follow a calisthensics routine and go swimming ocassionally. I'm also eating way more healthy. My daily intake consists of avocado on bread with eggs, greek yoghurt with bananas and a lot of whole grain stuff with raisins, aswell as pasta with brocolli for dinner and a protein shake with banana, almond milk and peanut butter to finish the day off. I'm at 56kgs with the goal of hitting atleast 60kgs in the next months. Stress wise, I'm not full time working on my own YouTube and Twitch channel anymore, I'm now freelancing for other people. Pay is better, stress is sometimes even more.

With that being said, my palpitations just come and go like they want to. Minus the protein shake, I've been eating like that for half a year now and sometimes they're away for weeks and I get to feel what's life like before I became aware of the existence of skipped heart beats and sometimes I have a lot of them in one day, 1 week, 1 month. I was actually convinced that the skipped heart beats are digestion related until they just didn't happen anymore while I changed nothing.

So how's my health anxiety going?

Well... while I've been told that heart palpitations aren't ""lethal"" I'm still scared about them just going crazy at some point and triggering cardiac arrest. I'm also scared about the skipped heart beats clogging up my veins and me having a stroke at some point. I don't even know any more if that can happen, but my brain remembers it like that.

My body has developed various points of pain. Arms randomly hurting, legs randomly hurting. A burning sensation here, a burning senstation there. Sometimes it's weeks without, sometimes for a few days througout the day. What seemed to have helped are stretches and doing dumbell curls.

One time I had a really really bad case where both arms hurt, went to bed, woke up again and especially my left arm hurt even more - went to the doc, he put some **Ointment** on the left one and it just stopped for a year until it returned to the point of much less pain just being there occasionally. I do however have an appointment with a neurologist next month, so I'm looking forward to either finding out that my body is a ruin and there's hope or that my body is a ruin and slowy crumbles because the 1.5% risk of getting Multiple Sklerose as my mother has it was just very welcoming for my body. Funnily enough 2 out of 3 doctors were against MS and the other 1 immediatly jumped to MS the moment I mentioned that my mother has it.

And then there's the reason I wrote this post. With my recently developed chest pains that range from 1-3 second long pinches somewhere around the heart region with varying intensities from ""little annoying"" to ""oh boy, is it actually happening?"" it's been difficult not to think about heart problems again if every single thing my body wants me to know about is happening on the left side of my body.

What's not only happening to the left side of my body is the twitching when I want to relax, that's also happening to the right side... and also to my tongue. Just for over 2 months now, the left tip of my tongue started twitching while I had a cold. Since my body likes variety and gets bored quickly, the twitching went from the top left tip to the left side and the right side, the whole front and the rear part. The twitch is actually really really subtle but the other sensation that's going on is - imagine the tongue as a rectangle and the upper left point is being pulled toward the lower left point. That is the sensation, but the tongue is really not moving much at all while that happens. It does cause a tiny lisp when it's a stronger pull though and I've noticed, for 2 extreme cases where I had that, is the process of swallowing is nearly impossible because my tongue or throat gets kinda ""stunned"". For this problem I actually do have an idea where it could come from though! In both moments where it was as ""severe"" I made some sudden moves with my neck and that seemed to have triggered it. I couldn't recreate it so far, but it could be neck tension based.

It honestly may all be down to my body being way more tense than I expect and anxiety just chilling there and doing its thing more subtly while I've gotten comfortable with the active shocking symptoms of it.

Nontheless, thank you very much for reading this diary entry. I was just chilling on my chair when a level 4 pinch hit my chest, so I wanted to finally write my thoughts out. Maybe someone reads this and feels less alone if their problems :)

Stay positive and keep being healthy!

1183,One bad day and I'm back in the hole.,"I was struggling today with some work that wasn't even necessary, just testing out possibilities for my dissertation. Just like that, I felt the familiar thoughts and feelings of anxiety creeping in, but I also knew that if I stopped before reaching a solution it would just give those feelings more fuel.

And I did manage to work it out but all day I had that feeling, I'm not sure how to describe it, like your mind is trying to escape out of your skull. Now it's boiled over and I feel like I always do during bad periods. 

The thing that annoys me is not being able to eat. My mouth is so dry and my throat feels constricted. Not even food I love feels good. I'm not sure if knowing my mouth is dry makes it even dryer but it just makes me mad at this point.



I know what the underlying problem is, working on a dissertation is inherently stressful, but I've been managing it so well for months now. I'm doing something I genuinely find interesting and awesome. I'm having fun with it. I can rationally tell myself I've been OK and I'm going to be OK again, but it's not a magic spell that can pull me out of this hole right away.

1192,How do you soothe your blood draw anxieties?,"I went back to the world of primary care today to get a prescription to help with anxiety among other issues. They did a blood draw and I almost passed out, it was my version of passing out which is just not passing out completely. I don’t like needles in general but have never had an overbearing issue with routine and emergency medial visits that required pokes. My sister does have what I would call a phobia, she is prescribed medications when she needs to get shots. The first time I passed out I was already anxious because the person drawing my blood was very young and he had to try a few times for a vein and I passed out a little after he left the room. Today my veins weren’t giving and the nurse moved the needle and that’s when I started to go. The doctor mentioned being asked to be laid down when I get blood drawn.

1194,anxiety in relationship...,"Hi! I hope all is well :) 

Apologies in advance for a long post. I have OCD and it is a big fuel for my anxiety. I have been in my relationship for over two years now and we are happy but lately I have been hearing a lot of, ""I need you to work on your anxiety, it's really weighing on me."" I want to acknowledge that this is an extremely valid statement, and I am so glad my partner is bringing this to my attention and feels safe enough to do so (I'll be honest, there was a time where if he said something like this I would spiral, but I've gotten so much better), it's just been a while and it's come up more and more and it's starting to feel like impending doom which is fueling the little OCD-Anxiety loop. I am at a loss, I have been in therapy and honestly, I feel like I have grown quite a bit. I see the little steps I have been taking and I have really been stepping into myself more and frankly, though they're little steps I am proud, but they're not big enough to make much of a difference in the anxieties I know weigh on my partner. the ones that fuel my insecurity, and the intrusive thoughts that tell me ""all these video's you're seeing about xyz mean you're gonna break up"" etc. etc. it's a destructive spiral of thoughts I'm extremely aware of, but genuinely I've done everything from CBT to talk therapy, I've tried journaling, breathing techniques. I need to do better, I hate the way I feel, but right now I don't know what's out there. I recently left for a camp as a counselor for a weekend and came back the happiest I've been in a long time. I was away from my phone and all the pressing things, it was a much needed break for me to get closer to god and myself, which is something that to me is important. but a few days later, miscommunication led to me going quiet and getting a bit internally anxious and then, ""you need to work on your anxiety..."" 

I'm not sating this in an ignorant way, I genuinely don't know what to do and it makes me panic-ey. granted, the last couple months there's been a lot happening that forced me to step into myself more, so I see these next months as I come out of it making me a better person in the end and helping me be more sure of myself. my question is, what else can I try? what else is there, how can I make sure my partner feels more comfortable and less absorbent to my stress and anxiety--sometimes I feel like they see it when I'm not even feeling it, almost like it's become the default and if I go quiet it's always what's wrong why are you anxious--I'd be open to try anything: apps, supplements, you name it. medication scares me, though it was offered when I was a kid it's not something I want to jump to but I am questioning it if it means saving my relationship.

1197,cardiac anxiety,"
i’m 19 years old and have been suffering from cardiac anxiety for about 3 years, but these past few weeks it’s been debilitating.

i used to smoke a lot of weed. like a lot. one night i smoked and while walking back inside i got a little startled by my mom, my heart rate went up. i went up the stairs to my room, my heart rate went up more. this is when my heart rate wouldn’t stop increasing and i started feeling strange symptoms. i was very short of breath, my hands were tingling, and i was experiencing chest pains. as someone who has always loved to google medical conditions, i immediately believed i was having a heart attack and i began freaking the fuck out. big time. i started writing goodbye letters in my notes app. i went downstairs to tell my mom i was having a heart attack. turns out i was just stoned. 

i tried to smoke again the night after but i felt the same. i repeated this process of smoking and having a panic attack hoping it would ease my anxiety like it did for my family but it only made it worse. 

after about 8 months i started smoking again but my tolerance was never the same, id take one hit of a joint and be on the brink of a panic attack because i could feel my heart in my chest, but as long as i kept talking to my friends i could get through it. none of them knew how i was feeling because i was embarrassed about it. at the end of november 2024 i got high for the last time because i genuinely thought i was going to die. i felt my heartbeat all over my body, it was beating FAST and HARD and i felt something in my chest that i can only describe as extremely uncomfortable. my entire body was weak, nearly numb. i’ve never felt anything like it. i tried to soothe myself for hours waiting for it to pass, i sat in my shower fully clothed because if i did die i didn’t want anyone to find me naked. sounds stupid, but i was scared and high. that night was the last time i smoked and i dont intend to do it again.

i was excited for my newfound sober-ness because i believed it would make my symptoms go away and if anything i feel worse. one little thing can set me off and at least as far as i can remember, this is the hardest thing i’ve ever had to go through. i can’t walk to class because i fear getting my heart rate up will cause a heart attack. i can’t talk in class because im scared my just regular anxiety will make my heart rate go up and cause a heart attack. i get a little chest pain and it’s a heart attack. my left arm is a little sore and it’s a heart attack. earlier i experienced what i believe is precordial catch syndrome and i lost my mind. i paced around my dorm for 20 minutes intermittently, trying to see if i felt better lying down or walking around. i immediately downed 200 mg of hydroxyzine. i started looking up other people on reddit with cardiac anxiety and how they get through an episode. those last two are my solid routine.

my blood pressure is completely normal. in fact, all of my vitals are completely normal, my blood test was completely normal and i know this. logically, i know that i am not going to have a heart attack. there is no history of heart problems with my family. i dont live the healthiest lifestyle, i vape and im not particularly a very healthy weight. but both of my parents have been in worse shape than me for their entire lives, started smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking at 12. they’re still alive and kicking. i KNOW that theres no way im having a heart attack but the physical symptoms of my anxiety do not obey my thoughts. it creates a whole new fear of, “what if i get cocky, thinking it’s just my anxiety, and it really is a heart attack.” 

i feel like a fucking idiot talking to people about this, and they only scare me more than help me. if i approach the conversation from a “this is just anxiety” standpoint, they urge me to go to the doctor to get my chest pains checked out. if i approach the conversation as if im genuinely concerned for my physical health, they’ll look at me like im crazy and telling me i should go to the doctor and get my anxiety medication figured out.

what i say here isnt even half of what ive experienced, partly because there are a lot of things i just cannot put into words and i dont think ill ever find the words needed to convey what i feel. what ive learned from this is that im not invincible. i didn’t want to know that at my age. moving into college, you’d except to have the time of your life. partying every weekend, making new friends, hooking up with random people, and this WAS the truth. for about a month. i’ve lost friends because i can’t hangout with them if im having a bad day. truthfully, the only thing ive found that soothes me is alcohol. specifically alcohol, in my bed, completely alone. this was something i fell into when i was a sophomore in highschool but i thought i kicked it. you always think you’ll be the one to beat the generational addiction until you understand why it started in the first place.

as i sit here writing this, (which frankly was not meant to be a vent, i wanted advice at first) i feel pain in my left arm because i worked out yesterday, my stomach hurts because im hungry and the pain is radiating to my chest, but the pain in the left side of my jaw is unexplainable to me. the one thing that i can’t explain will just make me think that everything else is a symptom of a heart attack, and i will go to sleep not expecting to ever wake up. when i wake up tomorrow morning, i will think im having a good day until im not. it’ll probably hit around 3pm. i wont be able to go to my class. i will have a panic attack. i will google. i will pick at my skin until i bleed. i will have 911 ready to dial because this time it surely is a heart attack. i will call my mom instead, crying because i just cant do this anymore. i will drink heavily until i fall asleep. it will repeat",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iuh7ud/cardiac_anxiety/,ConstantToe1237,1740108105.0,anxiety

1203,Responding poorly to my lab partner’s recent change in behavior & not sure of the best coping strategies,"Title sums it up! My lab partner and I are usually really good friends, and we do our labs for 2 different classes together. Usually, it’s very much a give and take where she lets me strategize and bounce ideas off of her and we go back and forth until we have a plan and then successfully can execute that. I’m used to her giving me space to be wrong without her immediately giving up & generally being able to laugh at our shared misunderstandings and pitfalls as we continue to work through problems. 

In the past idk week or so though, she’s become a lot less receptive. I know logically it is probably related to the fact that she has been in more physical pain due to a health situation and has been under more stress than she is used to due to the rigor of our courses finally getting to her (I was beaten down in easier courses due to lower than average algebra skills so I’m fairly used to being confused and bad at things). 

But still. When I’m wrong about something, she will immediately ask someone else how to fix the problem instead of trying to work through it together with a disgruntled impatience I struggle to sympathize with (it lowkey feels like cheating). And even worse, she doesn’t really respond well when I try to make bids and lighten the mood, and she will ditch plans/obligations or just be super shifty about when we can meet and work together and it’s been hard to communicate discomfort without it feeling like I’m overstepping/prying/generally just making it a bigger deal than it is and it’s making me really paranoid. 

Primary example: we’ve been working on an embedded systems project that I started for her a couple weeks ago when she had to leave early for an interview, and it’s due tomorrow. All week, I’ve been asking her when we can work on it/what time she needs me to be in the lab area so we can do it/whether she wants to work on it now if we are studying together, and today I come into the design lab to find that she asked some other people for guidance and tried to rush through it herself and got the implementation pretty much finished by the time I was there. Initially I wanted to go “wtf???” but I stopped myself and instead expressed gratitude and a sense of “you didn’t need to do that omg you should have told me you wanted to do it this time,” but in like a positive tone? Maybe I should have stood my ground more but it felt like any conflict would have been ill received. 

Anyway it’s these sorts of behaviors mixed with varying levels of people generally just giving me mixed signals this week that’s made it quite challenging to feel as if it’s not my fault that shes this perturbed. I worry that I am too insensitive to other people without realizing or that I am just a really annoying person who people dislike, but I am constantly surrounded by emotionally immature men who, while well-meaning and kind, definitely act in more grandiose ways than I do and still find themselves accepted and valued as good friends by the general populous.

20M
hey people of Reddit. I’ll try not to make this long because I have a recent history of posting about my symptoms all the time and it could be quite annoying for others but for those who are interested keep reading. 

2 days ago I started have a “squeezing” or more better described as a pinching/cramp pain in my chest that’s not excruciating. it’s more so subtle but enough to keep me worried and for me to feel uncomfortable. I’ve gotten every single test. EKG, Bloodwork, Lungs, Echo, all of them came out good and labeled as “fantastic” in terms of how healthy my heart is. I got my first panic attack in December that started off as heartburn & since then I’ve had a recent history of acid reflux every single day from December until now. I don’t know if it’s cardiac because all my tests come back clear, definitely worries me though. I went to an urgent care yesterday and describe a whole LIST of symptoms I have and even told the doctor about the chest pain I’m having and he ran some tests, funny enough he turned to me when he got the results and said “you are worrying yourself to death and you are perfectly fine from what your vital signs are showing. You’ve got your heart checked and it came back clear and you’re still worried.” He mentioned the only issue I had that was pointed out was the fact I had acid reflux for 2 months straight so he prescribed me omeprazole and today is my first day taking it. 

Though many doctors have pointed out that I am very healthy I still don’t believe any of them. It may seem silly since they are the professionals and all tests are clear as day but I just can’t grasp the feeling that I am “okay” when I don’t feel okay. The pain is mainly on my left side of the chest and sometimes I get a funny feeling towards my sternum. I feel like im going crazy at this point. I will leave a list of things I have felt in the past couple of months that stemmed off the panic attack that doctors claim are healthy with clear results. 

Chest Tightness throughout my whole chest. Almost feels like a pressure/cramp
Panic Attacks
Left arm burning/Cold. (Both never occur at once)
Acid Reflux everyday for 2 months
Severe Stomach Burning 
Heartburn occasionally 
Constant Twitching in different parts of body 
Pins and needles (cold) 
Chest pains usually when I eat food or burp, lingers even after I eat. 
Burning in back shoulder blade 
Sore shoulders

1213,Can thyroid malfunctioning cause bad anxiety??,"I’ve been on antidepressants for 20 years. Up until September, I was anxiety free. Then, I got a panic attack due to a situation happening at the time with my son. I have gotten panic attacks before and they’ve come and gone, no issues. But after this panic attack, I’ve never been the same. Anxiety came back, sometimes mild, sometimes severe to the point I thought I would never get out of it like right now. Sometimes the anxiety would be gone.

1217,Can I have some advice?,"I'm considering taking a break from college to focus on healing my anxiety, but I'm unsure where to start.

My anxiety is triggered when I feel betrayed, backstabbed, or when someone says something hurtful to me. These thoughts linger in my mind all day, making it hard to focus and sometimes even bringing me to the verge of tears. The weight of these emotions can be overwhelming, and I want to find a way to heal and regain control over my mental well-being.

I'm also unsure if taking a break from college will truly help, but the thought of not going to school brings me a sense of comfort, knowing I won’t have to deal with toxic people around me. At the same time, I’ve been considering transferring to a new school and starting fresh, but I’m scared that things might end up being the same.

Would taking a break be the right choice? Or would transferring and starting over be a better path? How can I heal and manage my anxiety effectively?

1223,Advice needed: anxiety due to work.,"This is going to be a long one but for context, I’m 19f years old and live with my parents still. I need help and answers because I’ve quit multiple jobs now after a few days due to anxiety. It’s been a pattern now but I thought I grew out of it until recently when the same thing occurred. 

Usually it starts a few days before the jobs starts with worries and then it progressively gets worse until the night before I wake up shaking and my heart racing. It’s so consuming that I can’t think about anything else and then convince myself to quit even if it’s only been a few days. 

I’ve really only held two jobs. One was a summer job at a water park and the other was a nanny job. I got through those because the water parks shifts were shorter and I could basically choose when I worked. The nanny job I enjoyed because of the kids and I sort of knew the family. 

I’ve talked to my parents about this and cried to them but they just don’t understand. They think I’m being lazy and that I just don’t want to work but that’s just not the case because I’ve had a dream job for years and I truly go want to work. 

I also did therapy for maybe three months and it helped me with depression and stuff but, I couldn’t continue it just due to the cost and I still can’t afford it. 

I’m typing this all out now because I don’t know what to do. I got a nanny job recently but again, quit right away and still feel terrible. I just was sick all day and didn’t sleep the nights before and the mom and I agreed that it was best for me to be done. 

Any advice on what to do in my situation is greatly appreciated. I can’t keep putting off getting a job either or my parents have threatened to kick me out and I don’t have the funds to live on my own.

1225,Should I go back on meds?,"
First-ever post, so here goes… As the title says, I need advice.

I’ve been on and off Celexa (SSRI) for 16 years—originally for generalized anxiety, but over the last 10 years, it’s been more for panic disorder. About two years ago, after a series of life events (new job, etc.), my panic flared up, particularly while driving. This led to episodes of derealization and obsessive thoughts about both panic and derealization.

Last year, I started working with my first anxiety therapist with the goal of no more meds and less anxiety. He introduced me to an exposure therapy program. Over eight months, I made incredible progress—no more anxiety in the car. Feeling confident, I decided to wean off my medication. I did so successfully and felt great for about three weeks, but then the anxiety came back hard. I had a small panic attack, but the derealization was even worse.

I tried reaching out to my old therapist, but he’s too busy to see me and he doesn’t accept insurance. I started with a new therapist, but so far, I’m not impressed. (Side note: If anyone has recommendations for a great therapist specializing in panic disorder and obsessive thoughts, feel free to PM me.)

Now, I dread driving every day. It’s exhausting. I obsess over my panic, and it’s severely affecting my quality of life. Driving itself isn’t the issue—I used to race superbikes. The problem is the obsessive thoughts and feelings of derealization which are exaggerated by the act of driving and the need to focus on the road. 

So, my question is: Do I tough it out until I find the right therapist/solution, or should I go back on medication? I will continue to work through therapy with the goal of eliminating medication.

1227,Has anyone successfully overcome severe dental anxiety? I cannot afford the repeated sedation anymore! (USA),"I have a long history of GAD, lots of therapy and psychiatry etc. always had bad teeth no matter how good my hygiene is, difficult getting numb etc. I was traumatized last summer getting a filling where the tooth wouldn’t numb. Tried a different day with Xanax and nitrous. Panic attack when the drill turned on. Was Referred to  a general dentist that is licensed for iv sedation. He got some of it done (incl shaving a tooth down from a root canal to prep for crown) but I was kicking and freaking out during it. He had to bring in a specialist dental anesthesiologist to sedate me to do my fillings. Went great but cost almost $2000 bc dental insurance doesn’t cover it.

Well fast forward to this week and one of the big fillings he did needs a root canal. No way in hell am I doing that awake. Years ago, before the traumatic experience, I barely avoided a panic attack and it was numbed well and I had laughing gas. 

I’m lucky I got into an endodontist who can do it Monday with deep sedation (I met both the endodontist and anesthesia Dr today and they were wonderful), but another $2000 out of pocket!!!!!! 

My parents have been helping me out, and I’m so grateful, but I need to get over the fear of the drill hurting. Has anyone successfully done this?

1233,Should talking to women come as naturally as talking to men?,"Hey,

I sometimes get anxious about weird things that most people probably wouldnt even think about. 

Right now im dealing with an issue where i’m struggling to feel and talk naturally with the opposite sex because i feel like i have to always consiously remind myself that they are normal people like men. If i don’t keep it in the back of my head and kind of willingly direct my thinking that way then i kind of lock up and become a little awkward. 
I’ve been doing this for years and weird thing is it has worked, i see myself as a likeable guy and i feel comfortable around women and i feel like they feel comfortable around me. I also feel like i understand our differences somewhat and dont fear to get initmate etc. It’s just that i feel like i’m forcing it now that i understand that i have to semi concsiously make assumptions about them being normal/similar to men. And thats what makes me lock up/doubt those assumptions/ not feel natural.

1235,Possibly anxiety but not sure,"23M Ireland.
For the past 3 months I’ve been having real bad issues that doctors are putting down to anxiety but I’m still not fully convinced (I don’t know what it’ll take for me to become convinced).

For context I’ve always been a fairly anxious person in day to day life and would feel kind of on edge about everyday scenarios but nothing too severe.
Everything started about 4 months ago when I started experiencing a few issues like shortness of breath and chest pains. I was taking nicotine pouches with an extremely high dose of nicotine at the time and I’d put the issue down to this so decided to start weaning myself of those. I then quit at the end of November. After this I started feeling the shortness of breath actually get worse until one day I was getting my hair cut and I felt like I could barely breathe. Had to go to emergency in the hospital, they took bloods, chest x ray, ECG and all was fine. Went a further 2 times over the next week and same tests returned same results. 

On top of the shortness of breath, I noticed I was getting extremely bloated while eating, even after a couple bites. I would have a twitch around my abdomen/diaphragm kind of area and was getting terrible acid reflux. It would take me an hour to eat a normal meal.
  
I’ve been to see multiple doctors at this point. I saw a respiratory doctor who actually discovered I have a dust mite allergy and asthma as a result of this, but I’ve been on the inhaler and will still get extremely short of breath. Also had an endoscopy which ruled out any major issues with stomach or esophagus etc.
I’ve also had pretty bad neck/shoulder pain for years now from what I expect was an injury I never got checked so I went for a cervical MRI and it showed no structural issues with my spine.

More recently (the past month) I’ve been unable to swallow food - it feels like I can’t initiate a swallow at times and even getting stuff like yoghurt down is tough. I’ve also been experiencing tingling and numbness in my hands and feet sometimes from elbow or knees down. Feet are constantly cold as well. I constantly feel dizziness, brain fog etc. (another reason I quit the nicotine pouches as I’d started experiencing this already when I was on them). 

Basically I’m not sure whether to put this down to anxiety. I’ve been referred to a mental health specialist next week, but I’m concerned that a lot of the symptoms I’ve had may be from some sort of neurological issue I’ve brought on myself from the excessive nicotine usage or the ongoing neck issues from the last few years combined with a pretty terrible diet and sedentary lifestyle for the past year. The reason it feels strange to be put down to anxiety is that when I go through occasions where it feels like I can barely breathe my heart rate doesn’t increase much at all. Then again I feel super on edge all throughout the day and my stomach is always unsettled and can’t stop twitching.

1236,Anxiety Symptoms over time,"Has anyone's anxiety symptoms changed over the years?  I've always been an anxious person, from a child I used to have panic attacks and nausea about going to school and it morphed into a fear of nausea, feeling full then onto an eating disorder which I'm still navigating at 30!  

Over my teen years it went into symptoms such as derealisation, almost like my world looks utterly unreal and the feelings are so overwhelming I wanted to die!

Into my late 20s and now in early 30s it's much easier to manage, I have propanalol for as and when and some diazepam when it really gets too much. It feels nice to have some meds for those types of situations. 

I'm writing this because I'm going through an anxious moment and it's helping, believe it or not!  What are other people's symptoms and have they changed over time?  Also, are people getting anxious over things in particular?  Mine is usually over bodily feelings such as nausea, feeling full from over eating or too much sugar, it used to be sleeping over at other people's houses and the cinema as a teenager!  But it can also be other situations like not being in control!  Unsure if anyone's in a similar situation?

1239,Social Anxiety Tips?,"I (30M) have pretty bad anxiety surrounding social situations, and I tend to overthink and revisit and ruminate on social interactions. 

I can tell when social situations become awkward, and despite being able to tell that they've become that way I do not always understand why. It's quite possible that I'm somewhere on the autism spectrum as well based on my family history, which is likely why I need to analyze social cues mentally.

This tends to come up in the office, where nobody in my location works on my team. I try to engage in dialogue with people there, but things tend to get to those awkward pause moments whether I'm in groups or alone. I often try to ask questions about them in those situations that aren't too personal. I feel like I'm the reason these interactions degenerate though.

There's the constant tension of the topics people don't talk about at work, such as political views etc, and this seems especially evident in my workplace. I am unsure whether I'm misattributing this to the awkwardness that I feel.

Does anyone here know of any common blindspots I might be experiencing, or that people have in generic office interactions?

1240,Irrational Unwanted pregnancy fears 😢,"A bit of context. I am 35f and have GAD and OCD. Usually well controlled.

Basically me and my long term partner split up for a few weeks and during that time I had a one night stand with someone. He pulled out but I took the morning after pill (ellaone) 2 days later just to be safe.

I have irregular periods due to PCOS so no idea where in my ""cycle"" I was and ellaone only works if it is BEFORE ovulation. This panicked me.

So... that was 12 weeks ago. The ellaone tablet can delay your next period, which it did by a few weeks. I eventually got my period.

During the last 12 weeks I have taken around 20 pregnancy tests.... all negative. As if I were pregnant I would be wanting an abortion.

Here's the anxiety riddled part....

I know logically I won't be pregnant but now that I only have a couple of weeks left in the abortion window I am uncontrollably panicking about it. If my partner finds out my life is ruined.

I took a test yesterday and today... both negative but I can't shake the dread.

I have put on weight recently as well which doesn't help. I'm constantly looking at my belly wondering if it's fat or pregnancy.

 * * * * I am not here for abuse about the one night stand or my decision to abort.. trust me I feel awful about it. And telling my partner is out of the question. Please kindly scroll past this post if you feel the need to be nasty or judgemental... I'm really in a bad place mentally.

1241,Severe Anxiety Nausea,"6 years ago, I started getting constant nausea and vomiting, this went on for whole year without proper diagnoses until one doctor diagnosed me with gastroparesis and prescribed some meds which treated my condition and made it manageable. However, due to spending a whole year dealing with vomiting and its resulting public humiliation, I developed an anxiety that is hindering my life. I cannot go outside without thinking about that I'm going to get anxious and vomit in public which eventually happens. My life is ruined, and I cannot continue functioning normally. 



My anxiety is so severe to a point that I'm developing new triggers everyday.

  
For example, being in a car triggers my anxiety and leads me to vomit even if my stomach has been empty for 2 days!

reading about nausea and similar cases makes my nauseous and leads to me throwing up!'

hearing someone talks about nausea results in me throwing up!

what makes it worse now my wife is pregnant, and she is having morning sickness which again drives me to throwing up!

I throw-up 3-2 times per day on a good day.

I became afraid to eat anything so that when I'm dealing with this issue, It is easier for me to throw up on empty stomach than otherwise!

  
I programmed my mind that taking pepper mint tablets counters this nausea thing, it worked for a while then it became useless.

  
Now I can't live my life normally and there's nothing I can do about it. on top of that, nobody understands my situation and think that It is all made up and it can be turned off like a simple switch!",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iu4q5z/severe_anxiety_nausea/,Desadea,1740074226.0,anxiety

1243,"My Anxiety Wakes Me Up Before My Alarms Do, and It’s Exhausting","I don’t know if this is just me or yall experience this too, but whenever I have to wake up at a specific time, especially for school, I only set two alarms, no more, no less. For some reason, if I set more than that, it would usually never work, or like would never set off for some reason (lowkey maybe its just me not waking up to it) and this already happened a couple of times.

Now, here’s where the problem starts. I absolutely hate being late, so knowing I only have two alarms gives me so much anxiety before bed that it basically acts like an “advanced alarm” but knowing I can’t add more because it has the potential of not working at all and I would end up sleeping in.

What happens is that my brain is already on high alert before I fall asleep, making sure I don’t oversleep. And when my first alarm goes off, I don’t just wake up, I wake up panicking, like my body is intentionally freaking out so I’ll definitely get up for the second one. There are even times that this anxiety gets so bad that I wake up with fear before my alarm goes off, sometimes hours before it. Then since I woke up, my brain and body will be on high alert.

This system has technically “worked” for me since high school, and now I’m in my third year of undergrad. But honestly, after all these years, I feel like I don’t get quality sleep at all. I wake up feeling exhausted and just… off. It’s like I’m constantly running on stress instead of rest. 

I’m wondering if any of yall ever experience this? or maybe something related? I would really appreciate if you have tips for me",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iu1f79/my_anxiety_wakes_me_up_before_my_alarms_do_and/,Prestigious-Aerie144,1740066155.0,anxiety

1245,"Chaperoning my daughter's school trip, nervous after the last trip I went on.","First of all, I'm using talk to text so I apologize for any typos, I am going to be shot burning my daughter's middle school trip to a big amusement park in April. My daughter asked me to and her friends like me so they are all excited that I will be helping out and attending the trip with them. Well last May, me and my family went on a trip to Tennessee and it was terrible. I had a complete mental break right before the trip and spent the whole entire trip in a constant state of panic, I'm not 100% sure why but being away just made it so much worse. I ended up in the hospital while we were on our trip and had to end the trip early because it was just so unbearable for me. Then once I got home I spent months just not being myself until I got properly medicated. I think I'm on good meds now and I'm not going very far. It's not a different state or anything, just a couple hours away that I am so scared that history is going to repeat itself. I'm going to end up back in that spot that I was before and ruin my daughter's trip. I don't want to let her down by not doing this and in a way I feel like I owe it to myself to do it and prove to myself that I'm capable of simple things like this. I want to enjoy the trip and make a memory with my daughter but I cannot handle going back to the place that I was before mentally. I'm not in therapy currently as I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD and I've started medication for that and when I was in therapy I just was not able to really process what they were telling me to do and it just didn't seem to help. My psychiatrist says that that's probably due to my ADHD. I'm also slowly leaning off of my antidepressant and I've completely stopped taking my Buspar because that on top of the antidepressant and the ADHD medication Vyvanse it was just too much and I didn't feel well on them. I suspect maybe a small bit of Sir Joe, but that hasn't been confirmed. I feel better now. I might have my ADHD meds raised at some point. I'm not sure yet. Still a pretty anxious person.

For me, whooping cough. I’m in the middle of an anxiety attack and writing this so I’ll stop compulsively googling the whooping cough cases in my county. Basically I read about it being on the rise yesterday, was feeling completely fine today, until I got out of the shower and I sneezed 3 times and had to blow my nose. Now I’m terrified that I have whooping cough (which starts with a runny nose) and I’m going to give it to my babies. Freaking out!

1250,Is this really “normal”?,"In December 2024, my life started turning upside down. Everything was going well. I’ve always been a physically active person, practicing jiu-jitsu, soccer, and running.

Then, all of a sudden, I started feeling nauseous and having diarrhea. For some reason, I took it very seriously and began thinking of the worst—surely, I must have colorectal cancer.

I went to the doctor. Took countless medications. Had numerous tests done since then—including a colonoscopy, CT scan, MRI, and endoscopy.

Nothing abnormal.

However, for countless nights, I could only think of the worst. I would wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. I would wake up in the morning, like a zombie, still thinking about it. And that’s how it went throughout the entire day.

Strangely, new symptoms kept appearing. For example, rib pain, hand tremors, blurry vision, and several other things.

My doctors kept insisting—and still insist: you have nothing. Absolutely nothing!

According to them, anxiety is causing these symptoms.

Since all of this is new to me, I wanted to ask you:

• Is hand tremor a common symptom of anxiety, even when you’re not actively thinking about the problem? Sometimes, when having coffee in the morning, my hands just start shaking.

• Have you ever experienced pain after hearing that a certain disease could cause it? For example, ever since I started considering the possibility of pancreatic cancer, my back started hurting. But it’s real pain. I press on the nerve near my rib, and it feels inflamed. Has anyone here gone through this?

I’m truly surprised—if this is really the case—by the impact that mental health has on our overall health, especially in cases of hypochondria.

1254,Toxic work place,"I have real bad anxiety. I have struggled with it all my life. To start, I worked at a job and I met this lady. Over 2 years we built a a close friendship but over those two years til now I have realized that she is one of the most toxic people I have met. She is quite childish for being 40 years old. She begs me for rides to and from work, tells me to go to the store & take her to get food. Yes she buys her own things & food but never even offers gas money. There’s been a few times I’ve had to ask for it. And yes I am in the wrong for not standing my ground but I just don’t like any sort of conflict as it raises my anxiety. This job really sucked & we were very under appreciated and underpaid. I made the “smartest” decision to move to a different job with her. This current job, her mom is the owner. Her mom is even worse. She talks behind people’s backs constantly. She says really hurtful things. For example; she has said that mental handicap people are faking it to get extra income, another thing, she says very vulgar racist things including the N word. And it just disgusts me. I have just ignored it as far as I can but it’s starting to get really hard to. The boss is even more toxic than my “friend”. She says nobody in our team does anything and constantly bitches about every little thing, saying she does the most, when ultimately it’s me and said friend. She has said nobody fills this paperwork out besides her, so I started filling it out, and since I started she hasn’t filled it out for months. Those are just little complaints about the whole situation. I can go more into depth but frankly i don’t want to, it’s disgusting. I have built these “ friendships” and I really just want out. 
I’m not sure what the next step I should take is. I know there will always be these people everywhere you go but I wouldn’t have close contact with them. And it is my fault I got myself into this but I just need help to get out please. They have affected my mental health so bad. I have been job browsing. I have a couple interviews coming up, it is very anxiety ridden. Going to a new place with new people. But that’s the last of my last concerns. My biggest concern is, do I put my two weeks in?, do I suffer for two weeks, and listen to them constantly bitch and moan and just overall be rude. They can make two weeks feel like two years. I’m not obligated to stay for those two weeks. I know that. But I don’t even want to deal with it for a day. Other options are to just quit , completely ghost them, say nothing. Or to just simply write a resignation letter , tell them not to contact me, put it on the desk, and just leave.

1257,Physical Anxiety Symptoms,"I can’t escape the physical symptoms of anxiety. Before I got into college, my anxiety was manageable to the point nobody really knew I was dealing with it. I could give presentations, be outgoing, and was impartial to social situations. However, since about my sophomore year everything changed. Physical symptoms started to develop such as gagging / dry-heaving whenever I got nervous. This has happened on multiple occasions, such as giving a presentation in college, buying a car at the dealership, and flying in an airplane. Anxiety has completely taken over my life to the point where I no longer feel in control. I tend to avoid social situations where I would be uncomfortable and possible end up gagging or dry-heaving in front of anyone. I’ve tried meditation, gum, having a drink on hand but nothing really seems to work. I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestions to get on the right path to recovery.

I work in the mortgage industry and my job comes with situations daily where things need to be done “NOW”and can be stressful when you are trying to get a file past the finish line last minute due to others poor planning. I get questioned, disrespected and dismissed frequently. Whether it’s by the sales team, the title company, or the real estate agent. I’m on the younger side in my company (30f, lol) so it happens often. I was wondering how those in similar situations are able to calm themselves when having major anxiety due to these issues. I know some may say the job isn’t the one for you if it makes you feel this way but unfortunately it’s the industry, especially when you are working on a file that has a lot of hands in the pot.

Now, my boss is a pretty chill guy by most standards. Polite, laid back, helpful about stuff when asked, etc. And if I do screw something up or he needs to talk to me about something, he usually does so on the same day and we have a conversation about it. So what’s my worry? Well mainly just that any goals we made from last year weren’t met and that he’ll surprise me at the end of the meeting with letting me go. 

I generally do struggle with anxiety and depression, but do consider myself a hard worker and don’t ever call off. But I don’t know. Catastrophizing has got a hold on me at the moment.

1273,my anxiety is destroying my life,"i’m 17, i’ve struggled with anxiety my entire life but it’s completely taken over my life in the last 6 months. 

in june i got a job waitressing and got my drivers license and for the first time in my life i was finally doing good with my anxiety, i no longer relied on weed to calm my anxiety down, in fact i rarely had anxiety at all. driving helped ease my mind and make me feel good like i was finally in control over something, but it ended the second i got in a car accident (around beginning of september). it wasn’t severe but it was bad enough that i have too much anxiety to drive anymore. for the first 2 months afterwards i could drive fine and my anxiety wasn’t too bad. 

around the end of october i couldn’t deal with living with my alcoholic mother anymore and moved in with my bf 6 hours away. moving from a town of less than 200 people to a city of 70000+  increased my anxiety tenfold, and now i can no longer drive without feeling so anxious i nearly pass out. i had to switch to online school cause i can’t handle driving anymore. 

my health anxiety is through the roof and i spend every minute i can muster up to drive at the doctors office for tests (nothing is ever wrong with me and thank god for free healthcare), along with having a severe allergy and constantly fearing i’m either having an allergic reaction or i touched something that is going to make me have one. 

ive tried therapy, anti depressants, ive gone to psychologists, doctors, ive tried self medicating, and the only thing that works is sitting in my room, reading or painting or colouring or some other bullshit activity. i don’t want to live my life like this, i need help and the therapists who just shove another activity in my face or another “technique” to work through my feelings or medication just don’t understand.

1280,Anxiety?,"Hello, I am a 23 year old male and been dealing with some problems that I think is anxiety during the last years. Here comes a story:

The problems started almost at the same time as I started working 5 years ago. During the first years that I worked me and my friends was constantly on roadtrips. I kept getting painful diarreas at sometimes when I got to stressed and sudden blackouts when I didnt know what date it was, where i was or the people around me was. I also had anxiety attacks on my work, I ran to the toilet several times and sat there hyperventilating (this was in the beginning, now I dont experience this at work). But during later years I have not been able to travel away from home.

Me and my colleauge was on a training course last year to learn new things in the work (I work as a mechanic) and this was when I first started feeling this really intensly. This was the first time I traveled away from home for a year. I had diarreas in the morning, constant needing to pee, dry mouth, ice cold hands, felt dizzy all the trip and could barely eat. I was constantly tired and did not even have energy to be social with the others on the hotel, just ate and then went to bed and watched tv or my phone a few hours. I've been to the same training two more times, everytime is the same eventough I know the place and the teachers. I can feel ""jetlagged"" several days after, but when I get home I get back to normal.

Last autumn I was away camping with my parents. I felt the exact same thing the whole weekend (Friday-Sunday). I did not enjoy the trip at all eventough I've loved it my entire life before. This was the first time we went to this camping for three years. We have been there since I was three years old, this was not a new place either or new people.

I don't know if this is anxiety or something else. I have recently been diagnosed with IBS and have had problems with my belly for several years too, but I don't think this is something related to my IBS. It is really worrying for me, I want to travel and do things with my friends but at the moment I just cant due to my body, brain anxiety or whatever it is. I called a doctor a few weeks ago after my last training trip but she said that it sounded normal because we are all unequal as humans, but when I cant even travel there must be something wrong in my world. Is this anxiety?

1285,Trigger Warning: Health Anxiety,"This post describes, for context, the trigger of my health anxiety. I’ve tried to hide it under a spoiler, for those reading this post who find health topics particularly triggering or upsetting.

>!Last year, I lost a friend to cancer. She was in her 20s, diagnosed with the illness only six weeks before her funeral.!<

While I have struggled with anxiety - to varying extents and manifestations - for as long as I can remember, I can draw a very clear link from what happened last year to my current feelings.

My health anxiety is not only about my own health, but about my partner. He went to hospital recently for some checks after some worrying symptoms, the hospital ruled out anything particularly serious or life threatening, but has some follow up appointments scheduled to help with diagnosis and treatment. My partner is fine in himself, and I don’t think he’s particularly worried - but I am beside myself with anxiety, trying to hide it but failing, and I think that is causing him now to worry. I feel like I’m failing him, not being strong and supportive enough. Then, the anxious spiral continues: I’m worried —> I’m not being supportive —> I’m not good enough 

Separately, we’ve recently started TTC and I feel like I have a “gut feeling” one or both of us has something wrong that will make this difficult. This is based on no evidence. I feel guilty for having what I feel is a negative attitude, but it’s so much more than negativity it’s just this health anxiety I’m struggling with.

I work from home by myself quite a lot and I think that’s when I can really spiral. ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iu0lwb/trigger_warning_health_anxiety/,bibbiobi,1740064058.0,anxiety

1292,How to deal with a difficult colleague as an anxious person,"As the title says, I have had some issues with a really difficult colleague. We were both new at the same time, and it seems as if she was cool with me at first, but at some point she started patronizing me and subtly making fun of me (which I didn't notice at first - I thought she was laughing *with* me, not *at* me). Later she became more overtly hostile, yelled at me a couple times, talked to me like I'm a child (even though she is my age), and many more kinds of bullying, but I think you get it.

I tried to complain to the boss (which I deliberately avoided so as not to be a snitch), but that backfired so bad. We had a ""meeting"" that started off with ""nobody has any bad intentions here"" and basically the whole point of it was to deny that any kind of bullying was happening. It was humiliating.

Now she is not as petty to me as before, but I still feel traumatized. Whenever she is near me, I fear I might say or do something completely harmless that she will take personally and use as an occasion to bully me. **I don't feel safe around her.** Even if nothing has happened for months now. I hope I'm not being overly dramatic.

My question is: what can I realistically do, with nobody on my side, to show her that I'm not gonna take it anymore, and to make her behavior her own problem (as it always should have been)?

1295,You are not important...,"You are not important...

Ok, read that again...

**YOU ARE NOT IMPORTANT**

This probably sounds mean and harsh but it is reality.

*The lady who looked at you funny on the subway?*  ***You are not important to them.***

*The kid in your class who you have a crush on?* ***You are not important to them.***

*The couple who you thought was talking badly about you while you were waiting in line?*  ***You are not important to them.***

*The guy at the stoplight you thought was laughing at you?* ***You are not important to them.***

The point is, is that everyone is truthfully selfish and they operate their day to day life inside a bubble that they have created. They don’t care about the way you look, the clothes you are wearing, your hair,  etc.

Embrace who you are!!!

I am not saying you are not important... you are.

I am basically saying you are important to those who matter to you...

Your parents, your siblings, your close friends, your family....these are the people who matter.

Don’t be scared to be yourself.  

**Don’t let people who do not matter, matter.**

Dealing with anxiety my entire life, I’ve always been worried about what others thought of me, especially strangers. It does not make sense. It is tough to hear but in your daily life, strangers in passing literally do not care about you. In 5 minutes you won’t even remember their face, as they won’t also remember you.

The beautiful thing about this mindset is that let’s say someone IS actually judging you and talking bad…does it actually matter? No because the strangers you see are NOT important to you. 

Be confident. Be yourself. Don’t let others' perceptions of you bring you down.

It’s a waste of your energy and time.

In order to feel somewhat normal I have to work out daily and avoid all sugary foods, and I still drink to get out of the house every morning. Recently I've been having extreme episodes of anxiety and intrusive thoughts at night which causes me to pick my skin like a methheqd and take ibuprofen for tension headaches daily. Like I said, this is something I wouldn't say out loud since I know it would be insufferable and mean, but constantly hearing about ""mental health"" and ""mental health importance"" from people who don't have to jump through nearly as many hoops as I do to live a normal life annoys me.

Here is where it gets weird: I haven’t had really negative withdrawal symptoms. 

I’ve had to stop taking it in the past to be able to take antibiotics, but that time I had awful withdrawals. 

I stopped this time a week before I ended a 4 year relationship and had the most traumatic time of my life. The only things I noticed were some diarrhea which has subsided, and lessened appetite.

1299,I kept overanalyzing people interaction. Does anyone feel this way?,"hello everyone.

I had a situation today that made me wonder whether someone actually hates me or if I'm just overthinking it.

So today, i asked one of the mandor if i can join her to the site ( I'm an intern ) and then she said she needed to update her log book first . I said okey then ask her if we still going to the same way like yesterday? and then she told me  "" yes and if you want to go first , then go "". So i went ahead first la and i think she would come soon after. 

But when i arrived , she never showed up and i ended monitoring alone. Later in the afternoon i saw she post about she going to the site . The thing is , she usually goes to the site after finishing her work in the office in the morning. So now i feel like she just wanted me to go alone in the first place but earlier she also told me she went to the site after she finished her work.

This situation made me think about how I often overanalyze people's reactions/interactions. Sometimes, I feel like certain people don't like me by the way they look at me and the way they talk to me but actually, they don't but sometimes I can't shake the feeling that someone really doesn't like me.

So how do you guys deal whit these kinds of thought?

1301,Health Anxiety and Propranolol,"I’m going to sum this up as quickly as I can, just because I could share so much more info but I’ll keep it basic. 

I’ve been going through a 2 week long battle of health anxiety/hypochondria ever since battling some sort of stomach bug or flu or virus the first week of February. I also have diagnosed GAD. The only medication I have is as needed hydroxyzine, but I’ve been scared to take it since that week with the stomach bug because I got sick and can’t tell if it was from the hydroxyzine or not. (Probably not)

I’ve had a wide range of physical “symptoms” these past 2+ weeks, but most current hyper focus is my heart. 3 days ago, I went to my psychiatrist and explained everything and he prescribed me 10mg of propranolol. 

The next day, I went to my GP, and we did an EKG that came back perfect. This helped ease my anxiety. However; my resting heart rate while there was 105-109. Oxygen looked good, blood pressure looked good. My resting heart rate was the same while at home yesterday. (I know this is “high” but please, no negative comments. I am convincing myself since my doctor did the ekg and all looked good and sounded good, we are okay) 

This all being said …. would the 10mg of propranolol likely be a good fit for me, based on my heart rate/physical anxiety symptoms? My plan is to take it for the first time this evening, but I obviously am anxious. Duh. Just curious if anyone else has had similar experiences to me and benefited from the low dose of propranolol? I really need some help.

1302,Anxiety in medical settings - how can I desensitize myself?,"
I’ve had generalized anxiety but found breathing exercises to be very helpful. But I also have specific triggers - the most common and severe one being medical situations. Even something simple like somebody talking over dinner about a surgery somebody had will trigger severe anxiety. I’m terrified of going in to see my PCP for a yearly check-up even. Doing it over Zoom is easier but the environment of the doctor’s office and medical-related conversations terrify me.

I’ve found desensitization work well for me in general. Are there any suggestions on how I can desensitize myself for this specific area? Perhaps by watching medical drama tv shows? Or any other suggestions?

Thank you very much.

The bad: i lack a solid friendship circle. I am still overweight. I have a *severe* vitamin D deficiency (14, with the lower acceptable level being 30). I have slightly low folates levels. I think i have gerd, had it in the past and i feel like i’m going through a flare up. 

Other than that my life is okay, i don’t have specific reasons i can think of that could make me anxious. And most of the time when my anxiety “starts” it comes on as an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach or as an adrenaline dump. I did regular blood tests and they were all fine, i did lots of heart tests and they were all fine. I have objectively no motive to be anxious. Am i just anxious about my anxiety and past panic attacks? 

It usually always comes on after meals, about 40min/1hr after meals. Not looking for a diagnosis, i am in therapy, but i would love some opinions and perhaps hearing from someone who had the same experiences.

1313,Intense emotions,"Why do I feel emotions so much more deeply and intensely than most people? Is there anything I can do to alleviate these overwhelming thoughts? Ive been this way my entire life, but maybe now I can make some changes? I find that I’m so hard on myself, and I really hate that. I can't seem to just be calm in my own mind, even though I try so hard. I try to explain to the people in my life what’s going on in my head, but no one seems to truly understand/relate. These intense emotions make me feel like I’m never satisfied with my life and focussed on things that I cannot control, and it hurts me that this affects the people I love most. Meanwhile, acquaintances always describe me as a nice or happy person, but truly at what cost.

What causes this? I sometimes wonder if it stems from growing up with the parents I had. I love my parents so much and am incredibly grateful for everything they've given me, but I think growing up with my mom guilt-tripping me all the time left some lasting emotional scars. I was raised by a mother who was never truly impressed with me. Plus my emotionally unavailable dad. I also would not blame my parents for this, I am well aware that they faced their own challenges growing up that caused them to be this way. Anyway, now I tend to overthink every little detail. Maybe it wasn't my parents at all and instead, I was simply just born this way. ig the the reason behind this doesn't really matter. Maybe I just like to play the victim and feel sorry for myself? idk

I’m sorry if this seems a bit frantic and I really hope that this made sense. hopefully this may reach someone who has gone through a similar experience and can offer some advicem or explanation. Thank you

1314,Why do I get angry at my special needs brothers emotional pain?,"I'm usually an empathetic person and sometimes joke and say that I'm like an emotional sponge, but sometimes that is not the case. Sometimes when my brother, who is very special needs, gets upset and cries, I get so angry and tell him to shut up. I don't know why but for some reason when I hear him get upset, it causes me an intense amount of anxiety, and I mean intense anxiety, and I automatically respond with anger. Instead of showing empathy and being patient with him, I get upset. And the reason why I experience that anxiety is because when he is upset, he hits himself. I'm always afraid he's going to harm himself. But it's not just that, even when he complains it generally just annoys me and it's like I don't care. But I know I should because I'm his big sister. I'm his helper, his friend, not abuser. So why do I get this way and how the heck can I stop because the anxiety is so bad I can't function half of the time. And the other time when it's not, I'm just depressed and don't care about how I respond to people. But like I said, I should because I am his biggest supporter.

1315,Protein anxiety,"I have tried everything for nearly 8 years so far,

And 3 years ago, i came to what is so called MTHFR gene mutation, and that there are two kinds of these mutations, either""undermethylation"" or ""overmethylation""

And if you haven't read about it before, i encourage you to do, but to make it short here, i suspect that i have overmethylation, because i have severe physical anxiety symptoms that are only triggerd by food, or right after eating.

In overmethylation, your body is having hard time dealing wity methyl donor groups found in protein, which is translated into excessive production of neurotransmitters like serrotinin, dopamine and epinephrine.

I found that taking SSRIs made my symptoms worse, SNRIs made it more that worse and also food, specially protein.

Also medications that seems to lower serrotinin like tianeptine, helped me a lot, specially when i am fasting, but if i eat high protein meal i would crash so bad.

1316,"I don’t know what’s going on with my body, none of this makes any sense","I’ve been struggling with health concerns lately. I’ve been having headaches and chest pain without much of an explanation, and at times I’d feel so dizzy and disoriented that it’ll wake me up from my sleep. I’ve gone to the er a couple of times and they found nothing wrong with me and the most they said is that I’m just severely dehydrated. 

Well I’ve been trying to stay hydrated and drinking lots of water throughout the day. And yet there are days where it seems to not be enough. Mind you I’ve seen doctors in between and had a full blood work up (including blood culture tests) in between for concern of a bacterial infection and yet nothing was found to be an issue except for dehydration. 

One of my biggest concerns and fears are that I may have kidney issues as I’ve been drinking so much water throughout the day and still there are nights when I woken up suddenly my disorientating headaches and chest pains but as soon as I drink a lot of water I am able to sleep mostly comfortably again. I’ve also been having pain and discomfort in my back (both upper and lower but at times predominantly lower). Even if these pains and discomfort are not correlated to dehydration, the issue remains that I struggle with dehydration. 

Now about a month ago I went to the er about the concern of my kidneys as I had been having pain in my sides and back and dark urine or urine that looked like there was blood in it (sort of pink). They did a full blood work up, urinalysis, and a ct scan as well. They put me on an Iv as well because they noticed I was severely dehydrated (which I thought was strange because I was drinking water throughout the day and didn’t make sense)
All of my results came back clean and I had no kidney issues. The doctor just told me that I’ve been under a lot of stress. I couldn’t really disagree with him because I knew that I was struggling with medical anxiety and stress around that. 

Since then I’ve had another blood test and an mri and nothing came back that be cause for concern with my kidneys or would point to a direct cause for why I struggle with dehydration or they physical symptoms I’ve described. The most that was found were that I have tiny simple cysts in my kidneys, the biggest being half a cm in size. However, I was told that they are not much cause for concern as they are somewhat common in people and don’t cause much issue. 

Even with these test results indicating that I’m essentially healthy, I still feel pain or have signs of dehydration particularly when I sleep even though I drink large amounts of water throughout the day. For reference, I go through about six or more bottles of 16.9 FL (500mL) of water everyday. I pee a lot as a result and try to drink more to make up for it. 

Lately also my knees have been feeling somewhat weak or uncomfortable as well. Not to mention that I’ve been getting these strange red marks on my hands that never used to happen before (as shown above and I will also include the mri finding of my liver) 

Now I should also include that as I mentioned before I had struggled severely with medical anxiety. I am ashamed to admit that I’ve gone to the er too many times within the last three months. I’ve had my blood drawn several times as a result and I’ve been concerned if perhaps I am low on blood in my system. But after opening up about it to my doctor they said that it shouldn’t be a concern because each instance of blood drawn is a small amount and your body tends to recover that blood relatively quickly. That being said, I am including this information in case there is something to be gleaned from it.

I am going to have an appointment with my primary care doctor to discuss this, but I’ve been so overwhelmed and afraid of the situation that I felt like venting but also try to seek advice as well. 

I understand if many may judge me for a lot of my hasty actions when it comes to going to the er many times. Believe me I understand and I’ve learned from them, and I am very ashamed for overreacting and wasting the staff’s time and resources. That is also why I am posting and seeking advice so that I don’t jump to hasty conclusions. 

Let me know if there are any things I need to clarify, I’m typing all this out in the middle of the night after being awoken from pain and I am too anxious to sleep right now.

I have spoken to both my mom, a friend , and my psychologist about the fear and  anxiety these palpitations gave me. My mom said that it was from anxiety, my friend said that it was a lot of built up stress, and my psychologist just said that she understands why i'm afraid and that it's ok.

I was so scared for my health that i quit nicotine cold turkey back when i had these palpitations. I live in a country that allows nicotine pouches, so i consumed about 100 mg of nicotine a day. So far the withdrawal symptoms have been depression, pooping and wanting to eat a lot.

I also started taking daily 2-3 km walks (30+ min a day), because i wanted to make my heart ""stronger"", since i felt so weak. 

So for today. I haven't experienced a lot of anxiety recently, i have been home alone for the whole week. I woke up with a heavy sensation on my whole chest, at first it felt like the sensation was on my heart area, but now it's the whole chest. When i got up to make some matcha tea i felt weird. 

I am having a bit of a panic since i'm home alone and scared, therefore these might all be panic symptoms (i have had trouble with health anxiety and a panic disorder prior). I mean, i don't remember correctly if this feeling was the same as last time when it turned out to just be the panic symptoms that made my heart/chest heavy. 

I want some reassurance that i'm not dying. I have an exam in three days and i want to meet my friends this weekend, i don't want to call my family to pick me up when it could just be anxiety. 

I have been consuming caffeine this past week, i'm not sure if it's a lot thought. When i quit nicotine i purchased ""nicotine free caffeine puches"" which i have tried, they all have 50 mg in them each. Maybe these are making it worse? I don't drink energy drinks, just some coffee with milk every day. Maybe my body isn't used to the sudden high dose.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1itv2ig/woke_up_with_a_heavy_heart_and_chest_a_bit_scared/,Affectionate-Result8,1740045570.0,anxiety

1328,Scared to death of..death,"For the past year, I’ve had an unshakable fear of death. It’s getting to the point of consuming basically all of my free thoughts. It came about because, at 24, i started experiencing health problems for the first time which brought the uncomfortable truth to the forefront: I am not indestructible. I am going to die. Hypochondria has also been a result- slight headache? Start digging my grave now guys i’m done for. 

Almost daily I’m hit with intrusive thoughts of ‘I’m not making it through today/ i’m dying very very soon’. If I successfully fight off an ensuing panic attack, I’m still stuck in a pit of anxiety for hours. 

Oddly enough it’s not the ‘nothingness’ aspect of death that bothers me, it’s the unpredictability. I get lost in spirals of imagining all the different ways I can die. Not knowing the when, where, why really freaks me out. I don’t like not being in control of my life. It’s driving me to drinking a lot more. 

Therapy has been no help with this. My therapist gives me the typical ‘death happens to us all it’s the one thing we have in common. Acceptance is all you can do.’ I’ve accepted it, its still upsetting and scary. I don’t know, does anyone have any advice on how to stop hyperfixating on this?",5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1itlw6z/scared_to_death_ofdeath/,No-Flatworm-5640,1740012926.0,anxiety

I just have no sense of direction of where my life is headed [note: I’m a senior approaching college graduation and dealing with multiple rejection emails from companies lol] That really is the cherry on top lol.

Additionally, I’m struggling socially because I think I’m finally in this phase where I am beginning to understand my friends are not really my friends. I really need loyalty in friendships and I’m not sure if mine are too me. That and having the same friends from high school doesn’t help.

1332,Constant anxiety,"Hello 33(M) have been dealing with mental health problems for around a decade now.. started off as a random panic attack while smoking weed then just went down hill from there. Over the next few years it progressed to near constant panic attack and breathing difficulties then all seemed to stop for about a year. It wasn't as bad when it came back but I started to have just constant physical symptoms even when I didn't feel anxious. I went to the er many times had blood work done, etc. Everything always came back fine so was unsure what to do. Fast forward about 7 years after the first experience while in the shower I get this weird dizzy but not spinning feeling in my head. Not really sure how to explain it to be honest. Then my anxiety flares up horribly. Then started with the physocal symptoms constantly again i.e.

-Breathing troubles, almost like I can't get a full breath so I continue breathing as deep as possible and make it worse or try to yawn to help it
-Same weird dizzy but not dizzy feeling
-Random episodes of motion sickness even when im still
-Entire body aches
-Loss of appetite, sometimes only eating once a day
-Throat tightness as well as extreme muscle stiffness in my neck
-Horrible migraines
-Random tics? Do not have tourettes syndrome, but was told I have stress induced tics? Such as popping my lips almost all the time or making a constant repetitive exhaling noise when talking.
-Having a hard time carrying a conversation without losing my breath or choking randomly on what seems to be air as well as mt voice then changing like my vocal cords were tightening and causing my voice to get higher.
-Talking for more than 5 minutes seemed to destroy my voice and I would get slightly hoarse.
-Lots of depersonalization/derealization and nearly constant brain fog
-Eyes sometimes feel blurry and laggy, like they take a moment to catch up when looking around.
-Severe sleep deprivation at times
-General feeling of just being unwell and or going crazy, pending sense of doom. 

Many others that I am more than willing to talk about. Biggest question is has anyone experienced any of these? I don't want to feel crazy and I generally have a decent amount of control over my anxiety but that's the part that gets me.. it has been 10 years and it almost feels like my anxiety is whats causing my anxiety if that makes sense. The physical symptoms. I can be extremely happy and distracted but they either stay during that period or come back to remind me every few hours. The other thing that seems strange to me as well is that my body seems to focus on a single symptom now. For example the dizzy symptoms isn't as prevalent now, my newest symptom(s) are this constant hot/cold feeling. My face, shoulders and neck feel hot on the inside while my entire body feels clammy but not wet whereas my feet are extremely cold and soaked. This is every day and night. Has been for a few months. I quit cigarrettes october 8th, 2024. I thought maybe the adjustments my body was trying to make and the repairs were maybe causing some issues because I know it can take awhile not just the 3 months as some say and you're better (that is bullshit). Anyways I thought maybe it was just poor circulation problems that my body had to repair. Second one is last summer I started to notice after either swimming or showering my face is getting the rest almost mottled look just not as severe as some others get in my forehead and arpund my nose. Have never had this problem in my entire life and I have spent most of it in the water. Few hours pass and the discoloration goes away no itchiness nothing just exists. I am 6""2 and maintain a mostly healthy weight and fluctuate between 175-190 depending on my diet through the summer/winter. I could honestly use more exercise than I do but my job (electrical mechanic) has really caused some issues with my body as far as soreness and such and makes it hard to do much outside of work anymore which i know is a problem. I haven't really tried therapy and I refuse medication, but I have had multiple tests done to rule out most things. Only thing thay has ever come back was low vit B and D as well as acid reflux. Vit b12 has since been fixed. D Is being worked on. And the acid reflux has gotten significantly better after qutting smoking. I don't want to keep wasting money on tests for no reason if anxiety really is just this much of a bitch. I'm pretty sure at this point I have health anxiety and I just make it worse. Sorry for the rant but would love feedback from other experiences or similar situations? Not looking for a doctor on reddit nor am I looking for someone to diagnose me. Just a little peace of thought that I'm not just losing my marbles. Any feedback would be great! Also am open to talking with anyone who wants to DM me as I am very open about mental health and try to be there for others as much as possible.

1333,"I can’t do this anymore, why won’t they prescribe me anything that actually helps","I need advice. I know that medication isn’t going to solve my problems. I just want to be able to have a medication that I can use as a safety blanket when I have panic attacks. I’m 24, I have anxiety and PTSD which has been a lot worse ever since I was sexually assaulted by my mom last year. I’m in therapy and I’ve tried multiple therapists in the past. I have yet to find one that’s a great fit. So all therapy has ever done is force me to dredge up a bunch of extremely painful memories with no relief. Im at the point where I have panic attacks maybe once or twice a week and they’re setting me back in life. I’ve been prescribed SSRIs, gabapentin, and hydroxyzine and nothing has helped my attacks. I exercise daily and I have a good diet. Sometimes I just can’t stop the overwhelming anxiety caused by the flashes of memories, and a single anxiety attack can leave me thrown off for a day or two. 

Does anyone have advice on how to get a prescription that will actually work for my anxiety attacks? I see a lot of comments about how it’s impossible to get benzos but at the same rate they’re still widely prescribed so it has to be possible.

I am 21 years old and I am still working in the same dead end retail job that I got in school, and I feel so behind. I hate it there, but I am horrified to make the jump and do something else. Every job listing I look at incites a panic attack. I have these overwhelming feelings of, ""you're too stupid to learn new things"" and ""you're going to hate it and embarrass yourself."" It seems like every job description has something of the likes of ""are you good at working under pressure?"" or ""can you work in a fast paced environment?"" - like no absolutely not and I do NOT want to. 

I have no idea what sort of job that would enjoy, and even a receptionist job feels like moving a mountain and a challenge that I can't overcome. I think about it all the time, even when catching up with my friends it's always something that is running in the back of my mind. I am on medication, but that doesn't even seem to be doing anything. I still stay up all night with a tight chest and have the constant burden of my fear and failure playing on repeat in my mind all day. I feel like I can't do anything - I'm not like a ""normal"" person, I am a slow learner and overthinker. 

If you read through this entire thing, I just want to say thank you for taking time out of your day to read my pyscho-babble. This is the first time in my life that I've felt completely and utterly helpless, and I just needed a place to put these thoughts.

1343,Does anyone else get anxiety from mentions or showcases of drug use?,"I would like to preface this by saying I do believe addiction is a disease and I hope anyone struggling finds the help they need. Tomorrow needs you ❤️

_________________________________

This might be a bit all over the place so bear with me.

I (27F) have never used drugs aside from alcohol with friends MAYBE 1 Friday a month if that, and even then I rarely get tipsy. 

What I'm talking about here are hard drugs. 

If a tv show or movie showcases drug use, I cannot watch it. I get anxious and while I may be able to take my mind off it and move on during the rest of my day, I will be thinking about it before bed and sometimes it even makes it difficult for me to fall asleep. 

My example of this is happening now while I'm writing this. I watched the SNL 50 show and Adam Sandler did a tribute song, he mentions Chris Farley. (I love Chris Farley's bits on old SNL, I think he was hysterical and taken from us far too soon.) OF COURSE my stupid self decides to look into his overdose case as I knew he passed from an overdose, but didnt know details. - Why looked into details when I knew it would give me anxiety, I don't know. - I am now in bed anxious just from reading the very professionally written article about it. 

I can see where some of you may think ""Well it's normal to be a bit anxious when looking into the reasons someone has passed, death is hard for many people."" And I understand that. 

What I question with myself is I struggle even in fiction.  The show Euphoria? I can't watch it. Breaking Bad? Same thing. 

A different example is I've been to music shows before where someone near us in the crowd was very clearly tripping on something pretty hard (his jaw was slacked and he was barely blinking, pupils were large and all around just was not ""all there""), I almost had an anxiety attack and needed to remove myself from that area. I then couldn't move on and enjoy the concert as all I could think about was the man.

Now laying here in bed, even thinking back to the concert, when I close my eyes all I see is his face. 

I understand where drug use could be triggering to former addicts or those in recovery. That makes total sense. But why am I this affected when I've never even partaken before? 

A theory I have is: Afear of mine is not having control over your own mind. That might manifests through this drug use? But also in people who are showcased in movies in mental asylums/institutions and things of that nature. Anything out of ""the norm"" for human thought and function scares me. (I apologize if this is offensive in anyway, I am just not sure how else to describe it at this time but I am willing to be corrected for better word usage.)

So maybe it's about that loss of control? I am not quite sure. Does anyone else relate to this?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ittl8n/does_anyone_else_get_anxiety_from_mentions_or/,Lonely-County-2493,1740039126.0,anxiety

i think this started when i was younger, i had no internet supervision so i was free to watch whatever i wanted. for the most part it was actually fine, except for when i found gore. i started watching gore, and alot of it, every night. at the time it didn’t (or i assumed it didn’t) affect me, but over the years it’s gotten worse i think to where i am now. i had depression and anxiety back then, and while i think the depression is quite stable now, my anxiety had rolled and continues to roll into a massive ball. i don’t usually watch gore anymore, but when i feel like this especially bad i watch it and it makes me feel worse. i don’t know why i do this either, i know it’ll hurt me and i do it anyways. it’s not even like i have any type of trauma either i feel so stupid, why am i like this? i really hate myself.

1350,Cold Climate Women Specifically…,"Hi everyone! As the title says, this might be specific to women who live in cold climates, but as soon as I put my big winter coat on I get over stimulated. As soon as that stupid puffer goes on it’s like I’m being suffocated. I can’t wear it to drive, I find it over whelming doing basic tasks in it, and everything just sets me over the edge when I have it on. 

I guess my question is, does anyone else experience this and how have you remedied the situation? Are we simply not wearing big winter coats and doing other things to keep warm?

1351,"How do you deal with the boringness of life? It's 7am, and I'm in a near panic thinking about how I have at least 10 hours to kill before going back to bed.","It feels like a prison sentence.  I've been sleeping more and more just so I don't have to deal with, this; *gestures around*.  With seroquel, I can now sleep for 11-12 hours and that's the best part of the day.  

I start to read a good book, I lose interest in 10 minutes.  I start to work at a hobby, and I don't get past setting it up before being distracted.  I've been on reddit for 2 hours now, and I've already gone over all the potentially interesting threads; and am now doomed to scroll all day hoping I've missed a few.  

Even things I would normally like doing are fucking CHORES.  The time is going by so slow, and I'm super anxious about what the hell I'm supposed to do today.  I can't just ""relax"", because I feel obligated to do something that resembles being ""productive"" in some way, and no such endeavor even begins to appeal to me in a way I can stick with it for more than 20 mins.   

I know this is probably more depression than anxiety, but they kinda chain together.  Depression takes my ability to feel entertained, and then I am anxious about being bored out of my fucking mind all day.

1352,weird tongue feeling,"for several months i’ve (21F) had constant discomfort with my tongue, both when it is resting and when i eat. i have a history of anxiety but im not sure if it has to do with this; it has just becoming draining for me and i miss life before this started happening.

i first experienced this in october, when my tongue and mouth suddenly got super dry regardless of how much water i drank and i couldn’t eat anything solid without choking, and sometimes it would be difficult to even swallow water and my spit. it got to the point where my body got so weak from being unable to eat complete meals.

eventually, it got better but then in the middle of the night about a month later it felt like something triggered it and i woke up feeling like my tongue wasn’t in my mouth. oftentimes when eating it feels like my brain has forgotten how to swallow food. also sometimes it feels like there’s something in my throat or sitting on the back of my tongue; at one point a couple months ago it felt as if something was crawling around my throat. 

i’ve only just recently been able to eat a small variety of solids, but tongue discomfort still occurs 24/7 and im constantly afraid of it getting worse again. since late november, i’ve been sleeping completely upright because it feels like my tongue is slipping when i lay down.

i went to the ER earlier today for this as well as recent chest pains and discomfort, but they didn’t say anything about what could be causing my tongue/mouth to feel this way. sorry if my description is messy, i’ve found it hard to find the right words to describe what i’ve been feeling. i was wondering if anyone else has experienced this before?

1357,Severe difficulty with making decisions for myself - any advice?,"I've recently started joking that I'd do great in the military because of how often I wish someone could make my decisions for me.

I am a chronic overthinker, to the point that decisions that should be trivial lead to me spiraling out. If someone asks me what I want - for dinner, from a grocery trip, what game to play together, what topic to pick for an essay - I rarely have an answer. I know a part of it is the people pleaser in me not wanting to inconvenience others or seem like I'm demanding. But more recently I've noticed that when people ask what I'd like or want, I simply do not have an answer to give.

It's not that I know my preference and am simply too nervous to state it - **I no longer have any idea of what I would like when people ask me**

I have two recent examples of this happening - The first is when one of my college friends was planning a DND campaign for people in our friend circle. I was excited to participate initially, but I dropped it after stressing out over the prospect of making a character ""I want to play"". My friend would ask me over Discord what type of character I'd like to play, and if it were a face-to-face conversation I probably would've stared at them like a deer in headlights.

My other example happened yesterday - the day I was supposed to choose a topic for my senior thesis/capstone. What's kinda funny is I knew preemptively that trying to pick a topic would feel impossible and likely lead to me spiraling out. I ended up having a conversation with my professor, who was incredibly understanding after I explained my situation honestly. I basically said that picking a topic myself would cause me more stress than the actual writing of my thesis. Thankfully we came to a happy medium where I told her a general subject of interest and she picked a specific research question for me around it.

I don't dislike having choices, but the anxiety I get has created this strong negative association with decision-making. I love the idea of choosing what I want, and I don't stress out over super trivial things like what to wear each day, but I think the reason for that exception is I don't really care about wearing clothing that looks good, just that it's weather appropriate. I do, however, get stressed deciding what to eat for meals because I take into account things like if I had the same thing to eat yesterday, if the line is too long, or if I haven't had anything ""healthy"" in a while and should just eat an apple instead.

This post is honestly more of a vent than a request for advice, but I am of course open to any words of wisdom or advice from people experiencing something similar. I am in therapy and I am medicated, but I really can only do so much on my own so anything is welcome!

**TLDR: I can't make decisions based on what I want because I never know what I want, and life would be easier if people chose everything for me and I had little/no say to overthink it.**",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1itj5sd/severe_difficulty_with_making_decisions_for/,Gadgetguy292,1740005508.0,anxiety

1359,Scared to take my anxiety medication despite having taken it before,"I’m prescribed propranolol on an “as needed” basis which has truly been a godsend for my anxiety in the past. I had constant panic attacks last year and every time I would take this medication it would calm me down almost instantly. I would take it before a high stress situation, like my graduation last year and my first job interview. I stopped taking it around July last year because I was super busy with work, I didn’t have the time or energy to experience heightened anxiety. 

I recently quit my job to focus on my college classes. Because I have more free time it’s been easier for major anxiety to seep in. I’m not experiencing outward panic attacks, just constant internal panic and anxiety. Lately I’ve developed medication anxiety, I’m so scared to take my propranolol despite obviously needing it and taking it many times before. I’ve convinced myself it’ll make me feel worse and I won’t be able to tolerate feeling calm, like i’ll be suck in an anxious thought loop. I just stare at my medication and cry. I’ve read stories from multiple people talking about how much propranolol has helped them, but of course there’s always that one person who had a bad experience. Now that I’ve read about those experiences I’m terrified i’ll placebo myself into feeling bad or feeling high/sedated. 

The last time I took it was in January this year. At first I was severely troubled and kept thinking “oh I screwed up and I can’t go back now!” but the feeling did go away and I was able to relax. I keep trying to remind myself about all the times it has helped but I just can’t muster up the courage to take it. As far as reactions go the absolute worst experience I had with it was taking a little too much one time on an empty stomach and feeling dizzy.

1360,Idk How to Process This,"I need help. This is the first time I’ve ever reach out on a platform like this. Or anywhere. My wife is good about talking me down about stuff. But sometimes I feel the need help from other people. 

I struggle badly with creating things in my head that are (hopefully) not true. Like badly. This goes back to some things I dealt with in my extended family and church in a few particular situations. I think I have PTSD from it to be honest. I had wonderful parents but they both are VERY much victim-mentality and it has caused me a lot of problems. And I don’t want that for myself. I refuse it. 

But here is my current thing I’m dealing with. My work recently asked several people to be in a video spotlighting a new product we have. Everyone declined, including me. It’s not typically something I’m good at. But I went back and said ok I’ll do it. We made the video. I felt decent about it. The video editor did an amazing job on the video etc. 

My work has never posted it. And It’s humiliating. My head just goes and goes all day thinking of why they wouldn’t post it. There’s nothing worse than public humiliation. It’s probably the single most thing I hate in this world is when anyone is publicly humiliated or embarrassed Everyone at my work saw the video because a few people have mentioned it to me. So that makes me think people are talking about it and it would probably make them happy if they knew it bothered me. I don’t let anyone know. I’m really good at hiding it and taking it tbh. I’m just being honest here. Not trying to be a jerk. But maybe I am. Just truly being honest here. 

At an after-work event the other night a co-worker said “have you worked on many xyz lately?”  (The xyz being the product my video was about). He was probably trying to get a rise out of me. I said “no and why do you ask?”  He said “I saw your video”. So immediately my wheels started turning. Now I know people have been talking about it. They probably thought it sucked. And now I’m the laughing stock. Luckily, I just played it off and basically just said no. 

Just to be clear: I am not suicidal in the least bit. It’s not like that. I just struggle processing things. And I don’t know how to get over it. I’m in my 40’s. A grown human being. And I cannot deal with simple things like this. This stuff happens to me all the time and it just eats away at me. And tbh, I want to make those people pay. And I know that’s wrong. I’m just being honest. My wife said they probably have a really legitimate reason for not posting it. And she’s probably right. But why has NO ONE came and talked to me about it.? Like “hey we went a different direction. Thanks for being willing.”  

More than just this issue, I really need help dealing with this mindset in general. It causes me a lot of problems. Thankfully, I’m mature enough to not bring it home to my kids and wife. Sometimes I do, but most of the time I’m able to tame my emotions for their sake. Something my parents did not do for me. 

Anyways, any help is appreciated. At the least, thanks for letting me rant. ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1itqa47/idk_how_to_process_this/,North123321,1740026392.0,anxiety

1369,Literally WHAT can I even do anymore?,"
I feel completely and utterly trapped. The anxiety is so severe that I actually do not know what to do with myself anymore. I constantly feel like I’m dying or going crazy. I have physical illnesses that I am neglecting because I am far too terrified to go to the doctors. It’s getting to a point where I just don’t feel real anymore.

For a bit of context, I have PTSD, BPD, Panic Disorder with agoraphobia, and suspected autism. I have recently moved home which was horrific. I got out of an abusive relationship last year and I was also assaulted eight months ago. I have physical health conditions such as hypermobile EDS, raynaud’s, hypothyroidism, potential POTS and autoimmune disease. I NEED to see a doctor for a check up, but I feel like I really can’t. 

All I think about, 24/7, is dying. I imagine my heart suddenly stopping. I imagine having a heart attack, and the pain that would come with it. I imagine suffocating and being unable to breathe. I imagine passing out and having a seizure. I imagine having a stroke. This is all I think about 24/7. The only thing that gives me a slight bit of relief is video games, but I’m finding it hard to even concentrate on them now.

My existence consists of living in my room and trying my best to ignore my mind. I don’t exercise because I am so terrified of my heart giving up. I eat one meal a day because I am too scared to go into my shared kitchen during the day. Going to sleep is a terrifying experience every single night, because I am convinced I will die in my sleep. I stay awake until I am physically exhausted and pass out. 

It feels like there is zero relief or help for me anymore. I have been waiting SO long for therapy. My medications barely work. I try meditation, mindfulness, talking with friends and family… but nothing alleviates the constant fear I live in. I am absolutely terrified of dying, I don’t want to die yet. I don’t want my family to go through the pain of it. I don’t want to die before I have a chance to even live, because it feels like I have barely lived for the past god knows how many years. 

Whenever I spiral about death, thinking I’m about to die due to yet another bodily sensation… the only thought that brings me a slight bit of relief is “well, at least I won’t have to deal with the anxiety anymore”. This is not a life, not even close. I am completely isolated, completely frozen and I don’t think I have a way out anymore.

Since then iv felt nothing but from around 2 days ago the feeling in my left arm has come back and I’m having constant pins and needles at night which is almost painful. This is causing me to worry a lot and often it’s ruining my days because of the thought that it could be something really bad.

1376,"I feel awful when my friends hang out without me, and I feel horrible about it","Let me preface this that I love my friends dearly, and they are the best people that I know. 

Some background: As of recently I’ve been extremely busy with many aspects of my life, and I’ve had little to no free time. This has caused me a lot of stress and has physical and mentally drained me, so I have been wanting to just talk or do something with my friends for a while now. It is also both of my friend’s birthdays in a few days and I always stress when it comes around. I also have been getting suspicions that I may have a form of OCD, along with my diagnosed anxiety and depression, which could potentially be the root of all my episodes, but I don’t know for certain. 

About a week ago there was an event that I wasn’t really planning on going to but both of my other friends were going to, and we all talked about it together. I was also invited to hang out beforehand because I had something to do halfway through. I wasn’t able to do that either and I refused. We also have a life360 group, so I saw that they did go and did a bunch of other things while I was working. They texted me the whole time and sent a video of like something that happened, they even bought me something from there. 

This happened before and I told them it made me feel bad, but there was more context to the last one. 

A few days later this kind of happened again, but it was a small shopping trip and hang out after while I was at work, and I wasn’t invited either. I was off before they were done hanging out, and one of them texted me saying they saw me get home. I know in my heart that this probably wasn’t said to make me feel bad, but I just feel like it was being rubbed in my face that I wasn’t able to be there. 

I’ve spent the last few days replaying this and how everything played out over and over, and I’ve felt horrible. I don’t want them to think that I need to be invited to everything or that I need to be included with the things they do because I don’t, and I’m horrified that I made them feel obligated to get me things or invite me to everything. I’ve been in a pretty bad mental episode from this, and I really don’t want to ruin their birthdays, I feel like whatever I get them won’t make up for how horrible I’ve been to them. 

I just feel unlovable, and that they only care for me, or include me is because they feel obligated to, or they don’t want me to be upset again. I don’t understand why I feel so upset and sad over something I know isn’t their doing or fault. I just wanna be a better friend.

1377,Is extreme anxiety really capable of causing this?,"I feel like I have been going crazy over the last 4 weeks. I was recently on upped from 10 mg to 20 mg Prozac during this period, but my psychiatrist has taken me off of them due to increased thoughts questioning every bit of reality and even my own existence. I’m now on day 2 of 25 mg Zoloft, but I wanted to share some of my symptoms and get insight as to whether it is possible this is caused by severe/constant anxiety, or if I should be worried about another underlying issue. I have recently started working with a psychiatrist and psychologist to navigate this whole ordeal, but wondering if I’m alone in this type of thinking.

Symptoms:
- hyper aware of my own existence 
- hyper aware of my thoughts (thinking about me thinking instead of letting my thoughts flow)
- constantly (almost 24/7) questioning aspects of reality/everyday life and overthinking literally every action I do and decision I make
- people feel “strange”
- Talking feels abnormal and distressing. Words seem weird and I’m surprised I’m able to still interpret and understand things. It feels very foreign.
- feeling weird when I do literally any normal human thing because I feel like I am conforming to a false/ignorant reality like everyone else
- unable to watch tv or videos because seeing people and people doing things feels weird
-unable to focus on work or other normal things because it feels strange doing them
-feeling like I am becoming dumb

This is literally the most distressed I have ever felt and I’m worried I’ll never go back to being ignorant to these thoughts and feeling normal and that I belong. I think of my newborn son and the fact that I might not be there for him and my wife because I’ve either gone crazy or harmed myself in some way to escape this feeling. I feel so hopeless and scared. I used to have confidence in things I did and considered myself somewhat intelligent, but now I feel like everything is slipping away. My therapist keeps trying to reassure me that this will pass and one day I’ll simply look back at this time as a difficult period of my life, but the idea of having normal, carefree thoughts again seems so impossible.

The US has elected a puppet president who, while not very competent on his own, is being piloted by some of the most evil, rich, powerful, and competent people on the planet that want nothing more than to push far right extremist ideas that divide us and make us easy to control, oppress, and profit even more off of.

Meanwhile, Russian funded propaganda machines are EVERYWHERE. Influencers take their money and indoctrinate kids every single day on YouTube, social media comments are flooded with bots that does hate and nudge public opinion towards alt right ideals, and people don't realize how effective it is. It's completely shifted the political landscape of America and no politicians are even talking about ways to combat it.

It's not just America either. Canada and Germany have elections coming up that are in serious danger of going to the far right. Germany's AfD is literally a Nazi party and they are polling well. I cannot believe it

Even Europe is a mess. Right wing parties celebrating victories all over, the EU leaders dragging their feet to support Ukraine, basically nothing behind done about Israel and Palestine.

We are rapidly heading towards an era of Russian funded alt right extremism across the entire planet. Once that happens, project2025 will destroy the quality of life of Americans to an insane degree, techno fascism will dominate the entire country and quickly spread to the entirety of Europe as more of these Nazi sympathizing parties gain control (and refuse to relinquish it)

1388,Help - SSRI Withdrawal,"I recently began the process of switching medication because it was no longer effective for my panic, agoraphobia and anxiety. 

I was on a stable dose of 40 mg of Paxil for 10 years which my doctor initially increased to 60 mg on January 1st 2025. 

That didn’t work after a month so we made the decision to switch to Zoloft. My doctor put me on a taper schedule where I was supposed to drop my Paxil 60 mg to 20 mg for a week. And then 20 mg to 10 mg for a week. Then I was supposed to go to 0 for 3 days and start Zoloft. I was never informed about withdrawal or tapering. 

After getting to the 10 mg, I had an extreme breakdown. Severe agitation and panic attacks and a sense of doom like I’ve never felt. 24/7 ruminations and feel like I need to jump out of my skin. Pain and burning down my arms. Pressure feeling behind my eyes. Vertigo. Nausea and stomach problems (in the morning). Headaches. Shaking. Goosebumps and sensitivity to cold. Sideation for the first time in my life and crazy mood swings. 

I went to the local mental health hospital and they had me immediately start my  Zoloft. at 50 mg. 

Still no relief. It’s been 18 days since my last reduction in Paxil and 8 days since Zoloft. My doctor now wants to increase me to 75 mg of Zoloft tomorrow. 

Has anyone had any similar experiences? Any advice on how to get through this? If I uptitrate rhe new med, will it resolve the withdrawal? How long am I in this fight for?

I am taking 0.25 mg of k-pin to get by. But even that isnt helping. Went to the ER twice and they checked my blood and ECG/Holter and all is well. Still very worried about my health and having permanent damage to my brain/immune system.

1391,I give up. My anxiety wins. This is the most I will ever accomplish in my career.,"Okay, so... A bit of background I guess. I work in accounting, and I got here through an unconventional path. Most people who go through the ""normal"" route go to school for a degree, then they sit for the CPA exam and/or intern at a firm where they get all the experience they need to become even just an accountant.

I didn't have the same access to education growing up, so long story short, I've had to get into accounting through an unconventional path. First I started at a temp agency. One of my assignments took a liking to me, so they took me on permanently. After a year there, I moved to a bigger company and I was there for 4 years. Then the company shut down, so now I'm at a new company, I've been here for a year and a half. Meanwhile I'm pursuing a degree in accounting just so I can catch up with my peers.

Now, here's the issue. I can't help but notice how much of my anxiety has held me back. I should be able to become an accountant despite my unconventional path. I should be able to become an accountant someday so long as I obtain CPA. I should be able to become an accountant because every single supervisor I've had praised me for being a fast learner and for being detail oriented. I should be able to become an accountant because I've gotten promoted at least once at every single job I've held. 

But...I feel like I can't.

Setting aside the fact that the accounting is hard, my anxiety has stopped me from learning so many times. Despite the success I've experienced, every time my responsibilities grow outside of basic accounting, I start to panic. I have anxiety attacks. In some cases, I left the job. In other cases, I stepped down from a higher level job, then I beat myself up for it.

I know I can be an accountant. I know I can learn it despite being behind. I know it because every single supervisor has been extremely supportive and saw potential.

But I can't become an accountant because I let my anxiety win each time.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1itgmlp/i_give_up_my_anxiety_wins_this_is_the_most_i_will/,banana-pan-quirks,1739999221.0,anxiety

He gave some antibiotics and told me to go.

Even if I tell him to go to the supermarket so I can poop (yes, it has happened), I cannot do it because I feel pressured on a time constraint. 

I have always had issues pooping if people are around/under pressure. When I'm on vacation with friends, I could go 5 days without pooping to the point I nearly end up in the hospital (and it's not because I don't want to, it's because my body physically won't let anything out).

I guess i believe it may have such an effect because they’re both processed in the liver. Forgot to ask my doctor when he prescribed it to me this morning.

1424,Don't know who needs to hear this but you should know about PPPD,"I had a bad panic attack back in October and have been dealing with anxiety and its smorgasbord of symptoms since then but one of my main symptoms that I was having was dizziness and the feeling that I was going to faint. Obviously not good feelings for someone who struggles with health anxiety. 

I've been to the doctor several times about this and they found nothing. Clear MRI, blood test completely fine, normal ECG, nothing wrong with my ears or eyes. That ruled out vertigo and any brain issues. But I was still experiencing these symptoms with no diagnosis and being brushed off.

Then I learned about PPPD (Persistent Postural Perceptive Dizziness) and everything clicked. I had basically all the symptoms associated with this condition and my symptoms came on after a bad panic attack which is where these feelings start for most people.

I thought I was going insane, felt like I was dying nearly everyday, and it was generally very hard to function with these symptoms. I didn't believe it was just anxiety. PPPD was my answer, and now that I know that, I have fully been able to accept that all these symptoms I'm having were caused by anxiety, as PPPD is primarily to do with the nervous system and the brain's balance system being off.

It took me months of researching, trying different supplements, exercises, doctor visits. But I now know recovery is possible. And it is for you too.

If you experience any of these symptoms there is a good chance you are also going through PPPD. (You should still seek medical advice to rule anything else out but once you have done the main tests – heart, brain, blood, ears, eyes – then PPPD is a good possibility.)

• Unexplained dizziness that feels more like you are off-balance, swaying even when completely still, or like you will fall over and faint when upright

• This dizziness gets worse in busy environments or with a lot of visual stimuli (like in supermarkets, when watching movies or gaming, in the car or on public transport)

• Your vision feels off or you have trouble focusing your eyes, eye strain, pressure in your head and behind your eyes

• Tension headaches

• Sensitivity to light or sound

• Feeling faint or lightheaded

• Brain fog and spaced out feeling, trouble concentrating for long periods of time, forgetting things more easily

• Fatigue even when well rested

This isn't an exhaustive list, but these are some of the main symptoms people with PPPD will report.

If you're going through this, here's the good news– it is not dangerous in the slightest and recovery is very possible. Highly recommend the Steady Coach on YouTube if you think you might be going through this. I know that figuring out the root of what was going on with me and having a greater understanding of what caused symptoms like these has helped me drastically, and I hope it will help someone here too!

As someone, who’s been prescribed benzodiazepines for years, I moved to my current state in 2022, found a new doctor who was vehemently ‘no.’ They’ve had me on a slow taper (I was on 1mg clonazepam 3x daily, prior). At this point in my taper, I am prescribed 2mg diazepam 3x daily-not sure what my doctor’s methodology entails, as she’s given me 80 tablets for the month, inherently leaving me short, if I follow the prescription bottle.

I’ve used the same cvs for the entire time I’ve been here; the head pharmacist has just been…utterly terrible. First and foremost, a few months ago, she put ‘my’ prescription label on another patient’s bottle, and sent it home with them…I’ve always abided by the store’s “28 days from last refill” policy, as the system will automatically fill it, and I’ll pick up when ready.

Last month, when my prescription was ready for pickup, the pharmacist said “you’ve picked up on the 28th day, for the last two months. I’m holding your prescription next month.” That didn’t quite register, mentally, at the time. 

I picked up that prescription on 01/19/2024…she’s holding it until the 21st; not on my doctor’s orders, but rather her own…33 days from the last refill? I’m going to be out of medication, by the end of the day, today. I called to inquire, and one of the techs said “if you don’t like it find another pharmacy.” 

I have no substance abuse on my medical history. Anywhere. I’ve never abused these medications, and I’ve never experienced a pharmacist making me wait over 30 days. It just seems unethical and inhumane, from my perspective.

1437,Heartburn or anxiety?,"At least 4x times a week, when I wake up I have this crushing/pressure feeling in my chest. Thing is, it goes away after I get up and stretch around. I usually sit on the bed, and stretch my chest out for 2 minutes and the feeling goes away for the whole day.

My anxiety has me focusing a lot on my chest area, so is it just my mind being like “Okay, you’re gonna have this feeling again the next morning”, or is it something to do with acid reflux or even muscle related?

Puedo moverme normal pero esa sensación esta ahí, me revisé la presión pero salió normal así que no se que será, estoy pensando en ir a urgencias ya que es la única manera que me vea un médico lo más rápido posible.

Si pido cita medica me la dan para dentro de 2 semanas y no le veo el punto. No se si sea la vacuna porque fue reciente y es lo más probable pero según los efectos secundarios no son en lo absoluto lo que tengo. O la otra podría ser porque soy trans y estoy en un tratamiento hormonal con estradiol y espironolactona. Pero hace un mes llevé resultados de sangre a mi endocrino y todo salió bien.

1440,"Does anybody else still find the gym excruciatingly anxiety inducing, even after going dozens of times?","I have been to the gym now about a dozen times and still find it excruciatingly anxiety inducing. I come to the gym and only go on the treadmill now because the other machines I always have to fiddle with to make sure it's adjusted for my height. Then once I get on, I am not even sure I am doing it right. It feels like other people are watching me. It's not even irrational because I genuinely see people looking directly at me. I don't know how to do weight training. Last time I tried to do weight training I picked up a weight and accidentally made eye contact with a guy and he gave me a weird look. Then I didn't know what to even do with the weight + the weight was too heavy for me anyway. Every time I get home from the gym I break down, just because it feels so terrible to be in the presence of all of those people watching me doing something I am bad at even after trying a dozen times. I feel like I can't survive at life. What do I even do.

I have been thinking of going swimming instead (my gym also has an indoor pool with a sauna, steam room, and hot tub). I don't know how to swim and will have to use a lifejacket, but I think it will be fun to wake up in the morning to go for a swim at the pool. It just sounds like a joy-inducing activity (and I need more of those). I just think it would be weird as a teenager to be going to the pool all by myself, and also be terrible at swimming and need to use a life jacket. I am scared someone is going to ask me if I am lost or something.

Also before anyone asks, I don't have any friends I can go with to the gym and/or pool.

My anxiety surrounding death has now increased 10 fold. I think about death constantly especially when I go to bed at night. Dying itself doesn’t exactly make me anxious, it’s the afterlife part. Like an eternity of just doing what exactly?? Nobody knows. I feel like I’m in a simulation these days and nothing is real. 

I’m catastrophising everything. I left my phone in the car and I made it to the office at work and wanted to throw my laptop out the window. I had to repark my car 3x because It was in the lines but crooked and I almost started crying. Whenever I think about credit card debt, I literally feel like the room starts spinning. Also my triggers are impacting me 100x worse than they usually do. 

I’m in therapy and I was seeing her once a month and felt like my anxiety and my emotions were in check. I work out 6x a week, I have a social life, and have a good job so on paper everything is fine. I even considered myself a person with great emotional regulation but not anymore. When I get overwhelmed I will literally curl up in a ball on the floor and cry and scream. 

Idk why this is happening but does anyone have any advice on how to get through this storm? I’m going to therapy early next week but what can I do in the meantime.

I am a foreigner in another country where I came relatively late in my life and started learning the language. It is a constant struggle but I am managing (sometimes more sometimes less).
I have people who are closer than acquaintances but not as close as friends - I don't have the feeling that any of them perceive me as a friend whom they invite because they have difficult time in their lives. That makes me feel sad.
I have a job that I can't handle because the position I'm in is much more complex than my knowledge, but it is good money and I need a lot of money because I have to support my family in my home-country. 
I have the feeling that I am sick more often than others. This leads to me, trying to work even when I'm sick, and then my colleagues warn me about it. 
I always feel guilty when I'm on sick leave because I'm always afraid that I'm not sick enough to take sick leave. And when i finally go to sick leave it is after min 5 people told me to do it. 
I'm afraid that people will get tired of dealing with me, because even my husband, who is very supportive, recently told (we had a fight) me that since he's been with me, he's not well because my mental illness affects him badly. 

Back to today, i am on sick leave for two days already and constantly spiraling because my boss is also my friend and she just told me that I have add in a wrong order the sick leave note, and that was it.  She did not contact me to ask how am i doing. So i feel like she is upset with me.
As a result of all this, for two days now I have had a very high heart rate (100 per minute), I sleep very badly, I only get 20-30 minutes of deep sleep during the night, I have a terrible uncomfortable feeling in my stomach and chest. Today I have started to hurting myself because physical pain brings some relief in this state. I think there is no way out of all this except death. And then I find myself fantasizing about finally being dead and all this pain that has no meaning ends.

now i cannot stop thinking about her comment. she asked me to keep a log of bp readings at home. at home my bp ranges from 130's/90's to 110's/80's (i take it several times per and take the average). and i am not sure if i am taking it correctly. it has been at least a month since my visit and now i am super scared i should have reacted sooner to this.

i am seeing a cardiologist on Monday but my bp is a very big scary issue for me. the last time i saw the cardiologist, she did not comment on my bp - i guessed it was ok?

However, in USA, anxiety disorder is always med first, and then psychology.

It's so funny, when I browse in China version Zhihu (like reddit or quora), every anxiety disorder people said you need to change your mind and characteristics, med will never treat you. Try to avoid med and quit med in the future. 

However, in USA, tons of people believe med is the only way for their whole life. A lot of people believe its genetic issue. 

I have no clue actually.

Then my mind had went into a gear of assessing the situation as me getting into an interrogation and immediately had short breath, not clearly giving answers to where i came from because I'm trying to sound like I am telling the truth, which in a weird was not factual.

it something that i thought i had got over from as some time back i had been dabbling into weed and kept it a secret and then embraced it.. which ended up disappointing my parents given they thought i could never slip into something like that. The sense of 'betrayal' took some time for my dad to get over. He still mentions his fears from time to time. part of the instances on the times i would go out and get 'baked' is the amount of time i took. Ive done other shameful stuff, but recently been sober for the last year or so and i opened up a lot to them about my struggles. Part of me thinks that in order to reassure them im not doing anything i shouldnt be doing, i tried to come at sensible hours, go with someone or rather just stay at home.. because any sense of exploration into the world outside would give way to oppurtunities of temptation

Any who, it was odd that today when i really did some sensible activities like going to a cafe, getting a book of my liking, and heading back. arguably it was a time past when i usually come back, but didnt think too much of that in the moment.

Its weird as after it happened i try to make sense of why its kicking in this way, and the thoughts of anxiety were a bit relentless. As im sitting right now, im even sitting in silence in front of the parents on the dining to not seem suspicious but still i feel uneasy.

I get massive body aches, headaches, chills, brain fog. I even have a swollen lymph node in my neck that aches. 

Are all of these symptoms really from anxiety?? How do I make them go away??   
  
I will feel like this on days when I'm not even super anxious about anything. The symptoms will then put me into an anxious spiral though, so then I end up freaking out by the end of the day and I feel 18x worse.

It’s a pit in my stomach that lasts practically the whole day. And it’s mainly anxiety about having anxiety at this point. I’m on Lexapro for about two months now but it’s not doing anything. Have been in therapy for about a month. He talks about acceptance as part of the journey of improving anxiety.

1466,Sleep Anxiety,"Thave a long history of GAD and panic disorder. My main issue was health anxiety - it was really really bad in January of 2024, and I rehabbed that last year and would consider myself in a good headspace when it comes to that in general. In fact, the only time I could guarantee I wasn't anxious was when I was sleeping.

The problem is, for about 3 months now, my anxiety has started to attack my sleep. If I have ANYTHING, I mean anything, out of normal (good or bad) going on the next day, I can forget going to sleep. From Christmas morning, to starting a new job, to expecting a package, to thinking about a flight I have in a few weeks.

On normal terms, I am a great sleeper. I sleep usually 8-9 hours a day, wake up occasionally but nothing bothersome. I used to be known for how well I slept/napped/etc. My nightly routine currently consists of magnesium and sleepytime tea.

Now, when I have a bad night of sleep, it consumes me all night and the day after. I feel so much pressure to have a good night of sleep the next night (like I know I can) and it sends me into a 2-3 days run of only sleeping 3-5 hours until the last night I am so exhausted I just pass out. I feel reborn the next morning and cant understand why I ever doubted I would sleep again.

I will add I have propranolol prescribed to me at 5mg as needed. l take it occasionally when I can't get rid of the physical symptoms of my anxiety. I know this med can cause insomnia, but I am taking it twice a month max at such a low dose I don't think its that.

Just mainly looking to commiserate and take in any advice. Part of me thinks this is just a phase and I will outgrow it, the other tells me I should be put on a daily medication for my anxiety, but all of me tells me I never want to worry about my nights sleep again. LOL

As the title says I’m truly miserable. Work is awful at the moment with a certain colleague. They’ve been a nightmare to work with since I started this role over a year ago but today it’s just got too much dealing with their attitude and rudeness. I’m so unbelievably anxious about going into work and I have to take a deep breath before even going through the door in the morning. 

Because work is making me miserable and I’m using the little energy I do have from day to day anxiety in just being at work my flat is taking a back seat and I am so behind on house work and chores. I get home and have nothing left in me to actually do anything so I just lie in the sofa all evening until I go to bed. 

I only leave the house to go to work I struggle with leaving the town I live in and I don’t look forward to doing anything so I can’t even use my free time to do the things I enjoy because I don’t actually enjoy anything other than sleeping and I’m not even particularly good at that. 

Anxiety is taking over depression is taking over and work isn’t helping either of those 2 things. I’m knackered.

1469,I wish I could be a normal person.,"I grew up in Spain as a Chinese person. I had problems from a young age. I overthought things, had trouble socializing, always spoke quickly, misinterpreted things... But people (especially my teachers) assumed it was because I was Chinese. The Chinese assumed I had a bad temper or was shy. So everything was... normal. Until I grew up.

My psychiatrist tells me to speak slower, my coworkers tell me to stop being nervous, my parents tell me to stop overthinking things, and I wish I could be like them. I wish I could be like them and just be happy. They all seem to fit together, and I feel like the mistake in this world.

1471,Uncontrollable bouts,"** * *Potential CW if your experiences are similar to mine and reading about them activates your anxiety * ***

I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and panic disorder for about a decade (and have been on various SSRIs since to some help, I guess... that's another story), though have dealt with symptoms since I have been conscious. The way my panic activates is bizarre to me and incredibly frustrating. I will go months with a base level of anxiety in my daily activity, and this is very manageable for me. However, it will happen where one morning I wake up at 6am on the dot with a painful chest and know panic is setting in. Then it doesn't leave for at least a week. I am in a state of panic from the moment I wake up until I go to bed. It will be the case that I forget momentarily during the day, but then it immediately surges back upon me (i.e. difficulty/painfully breathing, hot flash, nausea/vomiting, clouded mind). I am so exhausted every day but my mind and body are so activated that I cannot feel at ease. What is so frustrating is being able to reason through the 'feeling' and tell myself how irrational the 'feelings' are. Turning possibilities over in my mind of the root of the anxiety in hopes I will solve it and the tension will disappear, but a lot of times there is no answer. I have never felt assisted by therapy that I've tried (and can afford), and right now I'm not in a place to afford any. 

I am wondering if people have similar experiences with their bouts and what you do as successful self-soothing mechanisms, at least to help you focus on work to get through the day. Or if you have wisdom to share about this 'style' of panic disorder. The mystery of the pattern is also incredibly frustrating. I think it would be nice to hear from real people replies rather than Googling ad nauseum about my experience.

1476,anxiety and nausea turned me into someone else,"English isn’t my first language so Im so sorry for any mistakes or typos I will make, I just wanna rant a bit.

I’m 21 (F) currently a uni student. 

Since childhood I had a weak stomach (would throw up a lot according to my parents) but it was like any other kid and eventually it passed till I became a high schooler. I remember throwing up out of nowhere a couple of times in high school and get nauseous without a reason, i went to see a doctor but at the time they didn’t do any test and told me it was all psychological so I should take it easy. funny enough I got better (only got nauseous time to time) and it continued like that till my second year in uni.

I don’t know what triggered it but my stomach issues went wild so I finally went to see a psychiatrist first time (I was very hesitant because of my mom, she was always against it and told me I was fine and the nausea was only in my head, till I physically started throwing up everyday, then she pressured me into seeing one)
around that time in my life I only had a mild case of ocd according to my doctor (but anxiety was a big genetic factor, most people in my family had undiagnosed anxiety) and she prescribed me pills for it, At first it was cipralex and then when it started upsetting my stomach and show no effect she prescribed me lustral, tho none of those had any affect on me even tho I used them long term (like 3 months or more) and everytime I go to see my doctor she’d make the dose higher, I eventually got tired of it. My stomach issues didn’t disappear and I felt like the pills done nothing for my ocd either. And I was surrounded by people (not my mom) who bullied me into thinking taking medication was bad and I am better without it. so for some period I went on and off the pills, 

that year I got dumped (it didn’t really upset me actually since he always bullied me for using pills) and just after it a very big earthquake happened in my country and since it happened at night while everyone was in their houses lots of people lost their lives, and the rest of the country had to watch people losing their lives under the ruins which took a toll on everyone’s mental health then not long after I lost my grandma, she was one of the people I loved the most in my life. after these big events I used lustral for a while and then cut using it completely. 
I also got an endoscopy done, but they only sad I had gastritis…

while all of these were happening my personality completely changed, I used to go out with my friends and plan trips before and look forward to going out, but whenever someone asked me to join them or plan a trip I found myself wondering “what if I throw up” “what if there is no hospital near” “what if I get sick” and when I went out with them I couldn’t enjoy myself because of my thoughts. So I ghosted the people in my life and most of my friendships ended.

At the start of my 3rd uni year, the first time in my life I didn’t wanna go there. Wanted to stay in my home town with my mom (which is very weird because I was an independent person prior to that, that was the main reason why I chose to study in another city) but I went of course, my stomach went bad time to time but I had a very busy schedule hopefully that kept me occupied most of the time…

That year I had a very stressful task to handle which was getting a visa haha, in the previous years (while I was still independent and full of life) I took an exam to be an exchange student in Europe and to my suprise I got selected. to get scholarship and visa I needed lots of documents, and since my country wasn’t a part of eu I needed insurance etc. it was a very stressful process, running from one errand to another while trying to pass my classes also. Then my mom signed me up for driving courses in my hometown which added more pressure and stress onto me because now I had to travel between two cities regularly…well Iong story short, I passed my classes, got my visa and failed my driving exam. And also my stomach issues finally turned into a nightmare.

I was getting up nauseous every morning and start gagging, was throwing up whatever I ate, plain bread boiled potatoes.. my bowels weren’t working properly either and I was surviving just with stomach pills plus bowel pills. And had to move to another country in a month, for half a year, needless to say I was terrified. And I cried a lot and had my first and only panic attack, got prescribed lustral again and the doctor gave me trankobuskas for external use.

again, long story short I went, and I’m glad I went. It was the best period of my life, I got sick time to time ofc. Was away from home in a place I can’t speak the language of which was terrifying for sure. But it was something the old me wanted and studied hard for so I didn’t want to toss it aside. Also my stomach was so bad anyways it wouldn’t make a difference studying in another city or another country, I was going to be away from home anyways.
But I spent lots of time in the house there as well. And by the end I was so excited to turn back home (if it were the old me I’d be going out much more and stay even longer) 

At the start of my 4th year (yeah uni education is 4 year in my country) I was completely a different person. I despised school. I despised grocery shopping, Cooking… everything was so hard. I cried everytime I ate because it would make my stomach hurt whenever I ate, but it hurt even more when I didn’t eat anything. I kept losing weight and gaining it. It destroyed my immune system and I started to get even more sick. I threw up everytime I got my period. Had only one friend and no will to make more. Life was hell. I called my mom everyday in panic and cried myself to sleep everyday. 

It’s finally my last semester, (it will start Monday) and I am terrified. I can not repeat the previous semester. I only have 3 lectures in total and they are on Monday (2hours, diploma class) Thursday and Friday. It feels like such a waste of time to go to school for only 3 classes and they are all project classes on top of that. The teacher is very relaxed so I told him about my issues but he said we should talk face to face and find a path that we can work on and I shouldn’t hurry. I honestly don’t know what’s gonna happen … but wanted to transform my thoughts into words. I also got another endoscopy and tests done a week ago or so. The new doctor told me (looking at my old results) I might have partial stomach paralysis maybe , and my pancreas results were off. We are waiting for new endoscopy biopsy results (they said we’d have it in 25 days) I hope by that time I’ll be in my hometown to get a diagnosis beside anxiety.

Right now I’m not using any pills for my anxiety. Since my doctor is in my hometown. I can not wait to graduate finally and start a treatment. Both for my stomach and anxiety. 

I really hate the person I turned into in just a span of two years, I went from being a happy independent person to a person whose only focus is surviving and getting through the day. I am constantly living in survival mode, I carry a dozens of stomach pills in a purse where ever I go, carry a small throw up bag with me in case I’d need to throw up. I became mainly dependent on my mom in the process and can’t get anything done myself. What’s worse is since it’s not a normal “illness” no one understands what’s so hard, or how much I’m struggling.

I hope I can last 5 more months. Because I don’t know how much strength I have left in me.

I don’t know if anyone will read it till the end haha, I just wanted to pour my heart out, and turn my worries into words.. thank you.

I'm off medication for almost a week due bad management of my prescriptions (my next appointment with my psychiatrist is this friday, so I'll be off medication untill then).

1480,anxiety getting worse and worse,"hi everyone, i’ve noticed that these past few months my anxiety has been getting to a point that is impossible to control, i could be fine for a moment and when i think of something that makes me start overthink, i go down a spiral and start to have chest pain, accelerated heart rate and hyperventilating. I literally could be thinking about anything (future, friends, partner, work, family) and it almost never ends well without having these episodes which i have yet to know if they are anxiety attacks.

a little bit of context on what made me write this: today at work i was feeling pretty much in the edge, i was trying my best to not overthink because i know it wasn’t gonna end well (anxiety has been high for the last 3 weeks), so is not until 2 hours left that i start to feel how my heart starts accelerating because i was thinking of asking my supervisor for a favor (work related), then i started to think the what ifs and i got genuinely scared, hyperventilation starts and i go immediately quiet, my coworkers noticed it and ask me what’s wrong, i told them that i needed to ask my supervisor a favor and they encouraged me to do so, it was so impossible because i couldn’t speak and i had to hold back my tears, it went on and on for 30 mins until i had the courage to ask one of my coworkers to be my “support” and ask for the favor while i was holding his hand.

i’m scared of this happening because it wasn’t that bad before, i was a very social person and i was able to control my anxiety, now i can’t anymore. i suffer from tachycardia due to anxiety as well, i’m not seeing any psychologist yet due to financial troubles  so im basically undiagnosed of everything that goes on my mind, i wanted to know from everybody’s perspective if it really is this bad because my mind also betrays me and makes me think that im overreacting because people have told me that im too sensitive, and also how to deal with this while i work things out with a psychologist.

1487,Why am I experiencing these symptoms?,"Hello...I am 28F, overall healthy, recent lab work was excellent. For the past 3 months, I’ve had night sweats and what doctors call ‘panic attacks,’ but I believe it’s more than that. During these episodes, my arms feel weak, my fingers feel heavy, my hands turn ice cold, I sweat, and I get an overwhelming sense of impending doom. I’ve been to the ER twice—EKG and chest X-ray were normal. Doctors keep saying it’s anxiety.

Outside of these episodes, I have constant tremors in my mouth, especially the corner of my bottom lip, and occasional tremors around my mouth. My cognition feels impaired—I struggle to follow conversations, use common sense, and enunciate my words. I also space out frequently and feel disconnected.

Can anxiety really cause all this? What conditions should I consider? What medical tests could help pinpoint the cause?

A advice and any questions are highly appreciated",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1it3qag/why_am_i_experiencing_these_symptoms/,Wise-Original-1419,1739966039.0,anxiety

So I have this problem where I probably really need to go to theraphy. I'm missing out on school so much because of panic disorder, I'm too scared to go out and everytime I do something (which isn't often), I'ts really challenging because of anxiety and panic attacks. I've developed a fear of going outside. The problem is that what I need help with, is also the reason I can't go to therapy. I went digitally for a while but it was this whole big deal before every meeting and I feel like having a planned meeting is too big of a step in my exposure plan. Everyone around me says that I need to go, but I can't. It's too hard right now. How do I get better so I eventually can go to therapy?

I am a former alcoholic who during withdrawal experienced three seizures, one of which caused me to fall and absolutely decimate the bones in my shoulder while completely dislocating the other. The pain of this experience was at the time unimaginable and I was writhing and screaming at the hospital for hours. Since then I have noticed a pattern of anxiety and panic attacks that have only seemed to be intensifying as time goes on. When I fall asleep I might wake up not fully knowing where I am and it feels like the world is crumbling around me. I will sometimes be talking with friends and all of a sudden a feeling of extreme terror grips me and I have to go home. None of this occurred prior to the seizures/injuries. It has made it hard to drive, talk with friends or even my own family! It is getting to the point that I am starting to fear the fear! I am on medication for anxiety and I have tried upping the dose multiple times (with doctors guidance of course) and I am still struggling with extreme spikes in my emotional stability. I’m not sure what is happening and it is very frustrating and scary. I was able to see a neurologist and expressed everything I have written in this post and he explained that this was all normal.

1497,How’s everyone’s experience with anxiety?,"Backstory: I was on SSRI’s for 9 months, I stopped around April because I felt fine without it. Months later I took psychedelics around October, a heroic dose. I was caught in a bad loop and instead of letting go and going with the flow, I fought it. (I’m assuming that’s where my anxiety grew stronger.) Everything was fine until two weeks later I had an “anxiety attack” (assuming). It felt like I was back in the bad trip. It lasted around 5 minutes. Everything was fine once again. Two months later I had another anxiety attack. I had derealization that lasted a week this time. 

I am back on SSRI’s. I was recently taking 50mg of Zoloft. I felt okay along with some anxiety symptoms, but I felt that I can feel better so I increased it to 75mg. I know your body reacts differently to increase/ decrease of medication. It takes a while to adjust. I take mine in the morning. I feel fine before I take it, but after an hour/ hour and half I get waves of racing thoughts. Then my symptoms show up (written out below). By late afternoon/ night I feel like I need a “booster” to help me through the rest of the day. Something to help me control my thoughts and feel normal. 

My symptoms are below. They don’t happen all at once, they come in waves:
- [ ] Feelings of dread, like there is no future.
- [ ] I feel that time is going too slow. Like I am stuck living forever. One big life loop.
- [ ] Contrary, there are times when time seems to fly by. I can’t enjoy the day because in a blink it’s already the end of the day. 
- [ ] Derealization, that everything is just a dream. It doesn’t matter what I do because nothing is real. There is no point in trying or doing anything. (This one happens a lot)
- [ ] The worse of it all is the thought that I am going insane. That I’m on the brink of just going bat shit crazy. Running in the street butt-naked and end up in a psych ward. This results to me having an adrenaline rush/ fight or flight response. Breathing exercises doesn’t work for me. 

It goes in waves until I sleep and I start again tomorrow. Funny enough, the time when I’m in bed falling asleep and from when I wake up, I feel good. As if the medication works. Overall, I would say half the day I don’t feel normal. 

1. Do you all think I need more help? That I might be going crazy? Or is it that darn anxiety?
2. Do y’all have similar symptoms?
3. What medications helped you get that boost to help throughout the day?

1499,Help me please. constant urge to urinate.,"Hi guys. 
I’m really seeking help as my life has been on hold since this all started and I feel like a shell of a person. 

So last Wednesday evening I began showing UTI symptoms (burning when urinating). Within 2-3 hours I was in excruciating pain, felt like my bladder was going to pop and had blood in my urine. I went to the Doctors and was diagnosed with a UTI. I Was given antibiotics which I started Thursday morning until Saturday night (finished the full course). By Saturday all my symptoms had resolved except one. I have a constant urge to urinate. It’s mild, but anxiety has caused me to Hyperfixate on it. All I can think about is do I need to wee? Can I feel the pressure? and so I sit on the toilet often to no avail. I returned to the doctor on Saturday after finishing my Antibiotics and they retested my urine. It is clear from infection. 

It is currently Wednesday and this symptom has not resolved. Sometimes I can barely feel it, and sometimes it is more intense. But the anxiety and feeling that I am never going to get better and this will be my new life is terrifying. It is affecting everything, I can’t distract myself by going for a run, watching TV, spending time with friends, going to university etc. nothing takes my mind off it. 

I ended up going to the dr yesterday again about both the anxiety and the UTI. she believes I will get better and that I am making myself much worse by hyperfixating on it and prescribed me diazepam for a few days to try and calm myself down. 

I have sent the urine away for further testing to confirm there is no infection, but the doctor thinks this will come back as clear. 

I’m basically looking for advice from people who have also been through this or something similar and it has gone away or you have found something to help?

Please any help is so much appreciated, my life feels like it has been ruined and I can’t continue this way.

1500,"F*** YOU ANXIETY, HOW DARE YOU, a vent for my daughter","I just need to vent, I honestly just want to scream. 

My sweet daughter who just turned 6 has shown symptoms of anxiety in her short life but nothing we considered to be a big problem. However when she turned 6, just this January, she was having tummy pains, most likely due to constipation however we took her to her doctor who said yes, shes constipated but also advised to avoid dairy to see if she has a dairy allergy, maybe thats why she has tummy pain also. The pains went off and on for weeks but mostly occured at school. My daughter has a fear of pooping at school so she holds it in, it makes sense her tummy is hurting. 

Of course during this dairy free change, my daughter also had a cold and instead of blowing her nose she was sucking her snot in(sorry,  gross) and one morning threw up post nasal and then just lost it.  She became terrified she threw up due to a food allergy, she stopped eating. We took her to the emergency room, had blood test, nothing was wrong, no allergies except her allergy to peanuts which she new about years ago. We gave miralax and the pains stopped. However she was losing weight and barely eating because she is afraid of throwing up. The fear of throwing up has taken over her life.

She has meltdowns everyday, not once a day, multiple times because every time she needs to eat she is scared. She will take a bit of food, not even swallow it and cry that she's so super full! She will chew food for 20 minutes and not swallow. She asks 100x a meal if she will throw up, be sick, be okay. I told her we can't reassure her anymore. I explained anxiety and her brain is being a bully and I know how hard it is but don't listen to it, don't let it win, but she can't help it!

I found a therapist for her but she can't see my daughter until March. I got the book breaking childhood anxiety and OCD. I will do whatever I can but this is tearing our family apart. My poor daughter doesn't understand and she's suffering so much. She will finally move past a meltdown and then everything is fine but then it's time to eat again and the process repeats. She lost almost 10% of her body weight and the doctor said if she gets to 10% they would admit her for disordered eating. She used to love school now she fights it, doesn't want to go, is afraid she will throw up. Doesn't eat at school. I told her teacher and asked for my daughter to be checked on to make sure she eats and someone only checked on her one time. I understand there is a lot of kids in the  cafeteria but my daughter barely eats breakfast then isn't eating lunch and I cant help because I'm not there. Even if I was there she would fight me. She has no energy. Doesn't want to do after school activities anymore. She said she just wants to be with me and her dad at home.

I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. I blame myself. Her doctor told me since I have anxiety it makes sense she has it. So it's my fault. I'm so sad. I'm so angry I wish I could just grab anxiety with my hands and kill it. All I can do is try my best and help my daughter process this and hopefully the therapist I found helps.

The constant need for reassurance is horrible. Whenever she asks for it I say I love you, I know it's hard you are strong you can do this and she just sobs 😭 not long ago she loved food, she was a healthy child and I am losing her to this awful sickness and I'm losing myself. I never would have imagined that throwing up post nasal would cause a fear of vomiting like it has.

Last year she ate something that was exposed to peanuts and she projectile vomited everywhere and she didn't act like this after. I'm so scared for my daughter and I miss her.

One thing that I can find common in all of these episodes: All of them were preceded by a lot of prolonged nights of heavy partying, sleep deprived days, a lot of travel and little rest, with the mind being occupied at all times with planning the next thing!

1503,I have had an overreaction to a moment in fiction for nearly 10 years now...,"Trigger warnings for mentions of death and brutality and spoiler warning for a TV show.

I know this sounds stupid. I've known this was foolish and odd since I had my first breakdown about it, but I can't stop. I still keep feeling the same intensity. 

In 2016 I decided to give a TV show a shot. It had been active for several seasons, and I finally decided to try it. I started from the beginning and immediately attached to a certain character.

The show is the Walking Dead. The character was Glenn Rhee. Loved the guy, thought he was funny and had a lot of heart. As someone with anxiety, I tend to seek out spoilers to avoid nasty shocks. I had one anyway when I learned of that character's fate in the comics. Double my terror as I realized the most recent season seemed to be leading up to it.

I'm devastated and back off the show, unwilling to get even more attached to a character that I feared would  meet a gruesome end...but I still peek every now and then, hoping for some sign that it isn't going to happen. Finally, the season finale comes and I can't bear to watch. Instead, I monitor the social media feeds. I'm horrified to see that the season ends in a cliffhanger, and I agonize MORE during the following months, hoping that somehow they will change his fate. After all, they've changed other character's fates, so it wasn't impossible, right? 

Well. The next season comes...and it happens. I'm devastated all over again. 

BUT WHY?! I wasn't a regular watcher, I'd only watched season 1. None of it makes sense, and I feel insane. Now every time I see Steven Yeun, I feel the fear and dread, but I like him as an actor and want to watch more...but now I can't help having massive anxiety when watching his movies. 

I know this is absolutely crazy and unreasonable, and if anyone has advice on how to get over this and be normal, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1506,I Think I’m a Hypochondriac and it is Turning Everyone Against Me,"Hello just to preface this with some background info about my story:

I am a 16 yr old male and my bouts with health anxiety/hypochondria began in November when I thought I contracted the rabies virus from a dog bite. I, regrettably, made a scene about it and was saying my last goodbyes to everyone I knew which yes, in hindsight I feel like that was a very shitty thing to do but obviously I thought I actually had the virus and was going to die. This started because I was nipped by a dog while the owner was walking it but it didn’t actually penetrate me. I was feeling great and optimistic until I started feeling actual physical symptoms like muscle twitches throughout my body that still happen to this day.

My last visit to the hospital was because I thought I had a kidney stone which was one of my biggest fears alongside rabies so I was very scared. The thing with my anxiety is I believe I genuinely have something wrong with me and doctors will not help me because I feel symptoms all over my body which is the breaking point for my anxiety and makes me think I’m dying.

The reason why I am struggling more mentally is because my best friends parents let me know that they “will always be there whenever” for me because I was also experiencing suicidal thoughts and they were comforting me at that time. My problem now is when I asked his parents if they could take me to the hospital because of my “kidney stone” they don’t seem to care about me and think I am using them even though they explicitly said they would be there and to call them about anything. My thought process is that if someone says something then that is what they truly mean but it sounds like they were just lying. This is really stressful for me and I feel like I don’t have much time left everyday I wake up. 

Please someone help me on what to do because I know there is something wrong with me but I am being labeled as a ‘hypochondriac’",4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1isvp5k/i_think_im_a_hypochondriac_and_it_is_turning/,Peegwe69,1739935326.0,anxiety

1513,Emergency room visits!,"(Not looking for advice, just a quick question)
Good morning, everyone (it’s 2:40am here in Philadelphia). In the last year I’ve gone to the hospital almost 10x in the last year for a “heart attack.” Like chest pain, discomfort, anxiety, trouble breathing, numbness and tingling, etc. Fortunately, every single time, all of my tests came back with flying colors. My blood work and heart health are surprisingly good. It’s not very reaffirming though. They usually just tell me I’m having a panic attack, administer a benzodiazepine, then discharge me when I’ve calmed down. 
I’ve been in therapy for several years and it has helped some of my symptoms a lot. My coping skills help with minor panic attacks. But sometimes I’m so convinced that something is happening to me and it’s such a helpless feeling. 
In the last year, my best friend passed away, I lost my job and my landlord scammed me and I had to uproot my life and move somewhere cheaper where I don’t know anyone and leave all my loved-ones behind. It’s been very anxiety-inducing. 
I guess I’m writing this to see if it’s “normal” for people with severe panic attacks to go to the hospital? By normal, I mean have people done it before? I think everyone is so sick of me complaining about it. But when it happens to me, in my head, it feels so real and scary to me. I will literally hyperventilate so hard that my lips turn blue and I start seeing stars. 
I just moved here, so waiting to get on PA insurance so I can get a doctor to refill my medications. It has been such a tough and tiring road, smh.

1516,Restarting Zoloft... Help,"Hello,

I'm currently restarting Zoloft with awful anxiety.

I know there's a lot of stories I can read that will help me, but putting my own words and having people answer what I've written, I hope, will help me.

Long story short I was on Sertraline for a few years and it was stopped over a long time eventually in December and replaced with Mirtazapine. Apart from gain weight Mirtazapine didn't really do much, so psychiatrist has started Zoloft again at 25mg, to be upped in a week at 50mg.

I didn't have these symptoms the first time round, but after 4 hours, comes waves of anxiety, dilated pupils, heart racing, trembling, vomiting... I quit after three days last week but my psychiatrist and myself know that I need sertraline again. But just after day one today it has started again. Last week it sent me to ER cause I'd not had a panic attack in years and this one lasted hours and ever since my anxiety has been through the roof.

Will these symptoms subside quickly? I have Xanax which works and she says to take it 3x a day as well as Tercian (apparently an anti anxiety neuroleptic ; well in France...) only last week as I took the tercian I had a panic attack (sure it was because of sertraline and not Tercian) but I'm scared my brain has wired tercian=stress=panic attack. 

Thanks for your help.

1518,How Do You Cope With Anxiety in High Stress Situations?,"Hey everyone, I’ve been struggling with anxiety for a while now, and I’m curious how you all cope with it, especially during high-stress situations. I just took a new job that is way more stressful than any other job I've worked before, and I've been finding some techniques to help me cope in this new pressure cooker environment I'm in now. 

Here are some of the strategies I’ve tried that have worked: 

**1. Listening to Peaceful Music on the Drive into Work**

Every morning on my way in I'll listen to this playlist of peaceful piano music. This has really helped get me in the right headspace before going in. Linking it here in case it can help anyone: [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sRYWF8QV9nHjma4DLrRkB?si=f50bbf91c9ee49e9](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sRYWF8QV9nHjma4DLrRkB?si=f50bbf91c9ee49e9)

  
**2. The Pomodoro Technique for Focus:**  
When my workload is crazy, I try to break the work down into smaller, manageable chunks using the Pomodoro Technique. I set a timer for 25 minutes to focus fully on one task, then take a 5-minute break. This keeps me from feeling overwhelmed by the sheer size of the task and helps my mind stay focused, without feeling like I have to do everything at once. The breaks give me a chance to relax and reset, and over time, I’ve found that the constant shift between work and rest helps calm the anxious energy.

  
**3. Box Breathing:**  
Box breathing is a simple, yet powerful technique that helps regulate your breathing and calm your nervous system. I inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts, and hold again for 4 counts. It creates a rhythmic pattern that helps break the cycle of panic and brings my focus back to my breath. I try to do this for 3-5 minutes, and it makes a noticeable difference in my anxiety levels.

  
I'm wondering what other techniques you guys have to help you cope in high stress situations. Any advice is welcomed! TIA!",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1isvfom/how_do_you_cope_with_anxiety_in_high_stress/,Timely-Beginning6445,1739934543.0,anxiety

1525,We’ll get through this together,"Hi everyone. As I write this I’m struggling with intense anxiety and panic. It’s a daily struggle and I often feel as though I’ll never be able to get through this. I encourage you all to remember that anxiety/panic/depression is a collective experience in which we’ve been conditioned to feel this way. A small start to healing might be to refer to it as THE anxiety, and not YOUR anxiety. It strikes us all in quite a similar fashion, as you can see on this page. We all relate to each other. You. Aren’t. Alone. 

This isn’t what we want to hear, but it’s a strategy that’s been proven against the delicate passing of time again and again. Meditation and mindfulness. What we practice grows stronger. If we practice keeping ourselves in depression and anxiety, that’s where we will stay. The idea is to try and to keep trying. You don’t have to be good at it. You don’t have to succeed in meditation every single time but the intention to help yourself is enough, I promise. Do what you can. Take little steps. Take it a day at a time. I listen to someone by the name of Tara Brach. She uses spiritual psychology to help lead us down a path of healing. She does talks and meditations. They often make me cry because for the first time in my life, I feel as though I’m waking up to my anxiety. You can find her podcast on Spotify, and I think you can also access her content free from her website, and the majority of her work is also on YouTube. I’m fortunate enough to have a headspace subscription, but I know it can be hard to pay for something like that and to stick with it. Go for the stuff that’s free and accessible first, right?

I hear a lot of you say that you try and try but it’s not working. Don’t give up. Approach this with intention to help your anxiety. What you practice grows stronger. If you absolutely can’t vibe with it today, try it again tomorrow. Try again in a few days, keep trying again. What’s the harm in trying again? It’s better than letting anxiety lead the way. Just know that I don’t know you, but I’m rooting for you. I want to see you succeed, each and every one of you who came on here to share your struggles. If you can’t give yourself grace, know that I give you grace. So does everyone else struggling with this epidemic of anxiousness. You have more support than you know!

1533,Questions about sickness,"Hello!
I have been quite sick for over a week now and I have some symptoms that I have talked to my doctor about, but I am still not satisfied with the answers. Wanted to pop on here for some peace of mind.
First I want to say that I do not have Covid nor the flu. Just the good ole normal sickness symptoms such as nausea, body aches, headache, low grade fever. The biggest problem I’ve had has been my appetite. I go from EXTREMELY hungry where I am lightheaded to EXTREMELY nauseous, on the verge of throwing up. Been eating light so not sure what to do in that aspect.
Secondly, my doc told me I’m having some heart murmurs and that he heard some clicking when listening to my heart. Told me everything else looks normal and that I shouldn’t sweat it. Being 22, I understand that I shouldn’t worry and that this is a normal thing. Being someone with severe anxiety, it hasn’t been that simple. Ha. I have had misdiagnosed chest pain for years and years now (not just from anxiety), so one can imagine how something that simple made me feel. I’ve been in constant panic all mf day. I am planning on getting a heart scan as well as a EKG soon, but you know how docs are. Probably will take forever to get an appointment and I need peace of mind now. No, it’s probably not a big deal, but sitting here with the feeling of pressure inside of my chest and the SLIGHT chance it could be something more severe, I am not doing well. Not sure what I’m asking for here, again, maybe peace of mind? Anyone who can relate? Thanks.

1535,Had a huge attack for the first time in a while,"I have had anxiety attacks like this one before, and it wasn't as intense as the last ones since I felt myself spiraling and was able to come out of it easier than with others, but it still didn't feel good.. I was just drawing and minding my own business, until I suddenly felt a change in my chest that was heavy and my neck artery felt like it was hurting as well as my right arm feeling numb without me having been laying on it. I started to worry that it could be a heart attack, and looked up symptoms that I may have missed previously, but it continued to send me into a panic and I had to stop myself.

I tried rationalizing it: maybe it was from the amount of coffee I had today and I was finally crashing from the caffeine, maybe I was just stressed from the day or stressed about work tomorrow since I have to be in early, etc. But the rationalizing started feeling a bit hopeless, so I decided to shock myself out of my anxiety by going outside into the cool, crisp air. I of course wore a jacket and shoes, but the chill of the air was really cold and I shook violently as I stayed out there for a minute and went back in to do breathing exercises. 4 seconds in, hold for 4, breathe out for another 4 and so on until my body calmed down enough and I was done shaking. I felt the carpet in my hands as I sat on the floor, I listened to the refrigerator running, the clock ticking on the wall, and I looked around the room in silence.

I then decided to call my boyfriend since he usually helps ground me again, and talking with him made me feel a bit better. However, within the conversation, I had said that I feel too fearful to live, but also too scared of death, so I feel like I'm stuck in a limbo. I know that I will die someday, and that's the main thing that scares me out of everything.. something happening to me and my consciousness would cease to exist. It terrifies me since I don't know how it feels or what would happen when I do eventually leave this existence. I even thought of the fact that maybe it should just happen so I could get it over with, but I don't actually want that either. It was such a confusing statement that even my boyfriend told me I was being irrational thinking that.

I know I can't cope with this anxiety on my own, but I really try my best.. perhaps I really should try and go back to therapy, but that would take a bit to set up due to my medical insurance being practically nonexistent.. this is the first major attack I've had since May of last year, and I really tried my best to get out of it in the only ways I knew how. I think I'm okay now, still a bit shaken and my chest hurts, but that comes with anxiety.. I just really needed to write this all down to visualize it and feel better.

These symptoms could have been panic attack but I've had plenty of those and this was not that. I wasn't panicked and in fact I wasn't anxious at all. I thought there was a significant chance I was going to die and I did absolutely nothing to stop that from happening, no calls for help of any kind and no medical intervention during or after. Didn't even panic when I nearly lost consciousness, just accepted and even kind of hoped that this was it. I don't know what happened and I never really will but I have been under the weather so it could be nothing more than the worst of that or it could be more serious. Either way, I'm okay with it.

A bit ago, me and him were in his basement and he found his old hockey sticks and told me to just push a ball to him with it (I used to play field hockey so I’m fine holding and pushing it) but I just couldn’t.

1546,I feel like my anxiety is causing me to miss out on my teenage years.,"I (16m) want go out with friends and go to partys and go on dates but my anxiety always gets the best of me and stops me from doing that.

I am a pretty likable guy I think. I have plenty of friends and I get along with most people. I was even valedictorian my grade 8 year. Im a pretty handsome guy as well and I get a fair bit of attention for girls at my school. Unfortunately no matter the relationship it never stems outside of school. This is because anytime someone asks me out or invites me to something I get so anxious about it to the point where when the day of the event comes I just make up an excuse not to go. This has lead to so much regret.

Its a huge blow to my confidence every single time.

Most recently I was talking to a girl that I really like. She said that she would go out with me. I want to go out with her sooooo bad, but I get so anxious even thinking about going out with her. Its to the point where we were planning a date over a call and I got so anxious I had to hang up on her, go throw up, and then I went and texted her Im not ready for a relationship because I have to work on myself first. I felt so terrible after that. I see her all the time at school and I talk to her fine, but as soon as we plan something I get anxious and bail.

This is only one example. I have always gotten anxious about social events. I remember being 7 and driving to my aunts house for a party and feeling anxious. It wasnt as bad then as it is now but it has always been there.

I have also done many things that I was very anxious about and gotten through them just fine and there have been times where I wasnt anxious at all for social events. Like the time I was valedictorian. I had to read a speech I wrote in front of 800 people and I got through that just fine. I was incredibly anxious before it but once I got to the school I was fine. I just dont understand how I can be so anxious about little get togethers when I have done things that are much more intimidating.

I just want to be able to calmly go out to a friends house or go on a date without feeling so debilitatingly anxious. I know my anxiety cant go away complete and Im ok with that. I just want to relax a little. I want to be a teenager, and I want to live my life to the fullest without any regrets.

1547,Is it Prozac or me?,"When I was 18, I started getting really disruptive panic attacks. Mostly at nights when I was trying to go to sleep, but sometimes during the evenings. It would start as a sense of derealization, as if I was asleep or something. Then it became panic, like I couldn’t be comfortable in my body or where I was, and I had to escape. I was prescribed 20mg of Prozac daily, and it’s worked flawlessly for 4 years. Now, right around the 4 year anniversary of me starting this medicine, I’m getting the same symptoms. I have an appointment scheduled with my provider later this week, but as a proactive solution I’ve been taking twice the dosage of Prozac, just in case that’s what she recommends anyway and that way I’ve already got a jump on it to start feeling better sooner.

1559,Anxiety about rental home - marks/minor damage (NZ),"Hi everyone

I have lived at my current rental property for about 4 years but I have recently had some stuff happening and i've restarted and SSRI (prozac) to help with my anxiety.

My landlords are very precise, but generally nice people, that just like to keep the house in good condition. As an example they shine a light in the oven the ensure it is cleaned, but they are also very responsive to repairs. I once accidently pulled some wallpaper off with a 3M hook and they came, filled it, painted it etc with no worries.

However for some reason I have recently bene freaking out slightly about little marks and scratches I have found, and worrying about what their response will be etc. So like I found a scratch on the kitchen worktop last night and a small black mark on the bathroom sink (no scratch so dont know why it there) - and for some reason i'm really freaking out about it. I also have some velcro cable management on the carpet floor that I've now taken up and it's made a fluffy carpet line! I'm just feeling very overwhelmed right now.

I also keep thinking that i'm seeing marks on the carpet etc. 

How worried should I be? I take care as much as I can but obviously accidents happen but I do live in the place!

They have always said I take care of the place, so I am thinking that in my next inspection in march I will just show them and be fully open that it's making me worried. Just have a fully open conversation with them.

1560,been off nebivolol for 3 days but weird side effects?,"
to start, i once noticed my diastolic a bit higher than 80 so i measured obsessively, my heart rate was high, reached 130..140 
my systolic bp was normal but only diastolic got high.. 97…100.. and so on every time i measured

i visited an internist, did lab tests, he told me i only have anxiety and thats the case

he put me on nebivolol 2.5mg and asked me yo visit 2 months later
when i did visit my bp was 99/81 at his office and told me im very fine, but my heart rate was 111 because every time i put the cuff around my arm i get scared

he joked that i took all the oxygen in the room
asked me to continue the medication for another month and told me how to taper it off later so i can finally discontinue 

now my last dose was on friday, i measured my bp alone at home and the first reading was around 123/85 but again, i got really scared
i measured immediately after and i was feeling calmer, the reading was 120/84
then immediately after it was 107/76
with heart rate lowering till 85 

now… whenever i move i feel my heart racing and my systolic is going above 120 when it wasnt even a problem before nebivolol.. it worries me how the first reading is high then immediately after, like 1 second later im calmer and the reading goes down.. 

shouldnt the medication be already out of my system?? and if anyone experienced the same thing when will these side effects go away?? 

i really wanna measure my bp again and see it normal for the first time, i have extreme anxiety and whenever i put the cuff my heart races even tho i tell myself i shouldn’t be like that if i want an accurate reading!!

1568,I’m scared of my bf drinking,"Before I begin, I want to clarify my partner never gets aggressive when drunk, or anything like that. This is a fear I’ve had with every romantic partner I’ve had. My current boyfriend is also not an alcoholic. He only drinks on the weekends (as do i) and doesn’t get totally wasted every weekend, or even most weekends. Also keep in mind we’re seniors in college right now! I have no idea if it comes from something in childhood or what, but I’m just looking for some clarity as to why I may feel the way I do and what to do about it. 

I have a deep rooted fear of alcohol. Not for me (I have fun drinking), not for my friends, but ONLY my romantic partner. It’s not a fear of being abused or mistreated. That’s what makes it so confusing — it’s totally irrational. 

It’s to the point where if my partner is drinking, I need to be there with them. Even then, if my partner gets messed up drinking (stumbling, puking, even just being visibly intoxicated etc), it still makes me anxious. But far less anxious if I were to not see them at all. 

For example, if my partner is out drinking with friends or even at his own house with friends, I am anxious the whole night. Even just picturing him drunk freaks me out. The anxiety is significantly reduced if Im either with him when it’s happening, or i know I can see him after before the night if over. It’s so severe that one time I saw a video of him blacked out, and I thought about it constantly. 

For the record, I have never had an experience (that I can rememeber at least… maybe something from my childhood?) that would explain why I feel the way I do. Aside from my mom being a borderline alcoholic and borderline verbally abusive when I was a kid, I got nothing. And that wouldn’t fully make sense as the reason because I’m not scared of being abused by him… like at all. 

It’s just so irrational and I don’t know how to get rid of it. But it’s actually affecting my daily life and I know I’ll never be able to have a normal relationship if I don’t get rid of it.

1571,23 with Generalized Anxiety and Panic Disorder,"Sorry in advance, long read! 
Hey everyone, like in the caption, I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder. I was always an anxious and socially awkward kid, but in 2022, I started having really terrible panic attacks all of the time. It got to the point where I was afraid to leave the house or do anything in fear of a panic attack. A few month after that, I was prescribed Buspar, it really did help, I took it for over a year and then stopped because I genuinely felt like I no longer needed. Fast forward to two months ago. Everything above has started happening to me yet again. It got to the point where I went to a primary doctor to talk about my symptoms and she commented on my pulse being “a little bit high but that’s okay” I’d been previously told (in 2022, when this all begun) that really bad anxiety can cause a high pulse/high blood pressure sometimes. I’ve had an ekg done and blood work done, I was told that my heart was fine. Here’s the thing, I can be sitting completely still, no anxiety at all and my resting heart rate is upwards of 100bpm. I also can stand to go do something and it’ll skyrocket while I’m up walking around. Of course, this freaks me out and gives me even more anxiety. I am at my wits end. The only thing the doctors try to do is put me back on buspar (again, I stopped because I no longer needed it. That’s what they told me to do. I also have other personal reasons as to why I don’t want to be on medication permanently.) if it’s just anxiety causing all of this, what do I do? How do I make this all stop? I have a small child to care for an I can’t do it properly when I’m afraid to do anything bc my heart will not slow down. I also do not have the money/insurance to talk to a therapist.

I was ready before January, but after a traumatizing air flight that month, my anxiety's been intense—trembling, constipation, abdominal pain, stress acne, numb fingers—and it's frustrating because I'm not even committed yet, just applying, and my anxiety's already in overdrive.

I’m in therapy, but my therapist hasn’t been much help with this. I told her about my fear of being unprepared (currency, food, etc.), and she says I have to be ""counterproductive"" (??) but my anxiety makes that really hard. Plus, my parents are worried after our recent flight incident about how I’d handle myself over there if I had an anxiety attack without my usual resources, which just makes me more anxious.

I’m starting to have second thoughts about the program. I keep recalling my last international trip where I got super stressed, bed rotted, and isolated—which obviously I can't do during an internship. So for people with GAD and travel anxiety, how do you handle this? Should I put the program on hold until I build better coping mechanisms?",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iso991/gad_ruining_things_for_me/,pekoyamaaa,1739914103.0,anxiety

1574,Are there people who genuinely don't like talking to people or having friends?,"I myself am an anxious person and can be seen as quiet depending on who I'm around. I can also be shy in big groups. In school I have one class which I've been in since september and where I sit next to this one girl and she too is very quiet. Quieter than me too which I don't see anything wrong with and actually understand. However in my case I still do enjoy others company and am actually very loud and talkative around my friends or anyone I'm comfortable around. This girl I've actually known for a few years from a few classes and she doesn't seem to have any friends and she doesn't seem to like talking and I've actually never seen her talk to someone else unless she has to. Since I sit next to her I do try to talk to her and she usually just doesn't seem to want and is polit about it and that's fine. I can understand that she many not be comfortable around me. We once had to do a partner presentation (I was hella nervous) and when I'm nervous I talk more and I told her I was really nervous and she just kind of laughed. I was surprised to not see her nervous, but when we were presenting her voice was quiet, but for the most part she seemed fine to me. It just got me thinking does she really just not like talking to people or having friends? I know this can seem like a shallow way of thinking and thought pattern and thats why I'm here, I'm just puzzled. I feel kinda bad too because I'll ask her questions because I get confused a lot in that class (biology) and she never asks me. Also I miss school a bit much because of extracirriculars and will text her about makeup work (I got her snap cuz of the partner presentation).

1578,How can I stop sharing so much and seeking reassurance?,"To preface this post, I have diagnosed OCD. I’ve had the condition since I was about 5 years old. I’m now 37. Throughout my life I’ve had times where it got really, really bad and other times where I would say I basically achieved a level of remission. Mostly, though, it lingers to a certain degree.

Over the past few years, my OCD and anxiety have increased. Although I am managing it pretty well at the moment, I’ve realized that I have an issue with oversharing, seeking reassurance, and generally sharing any anxious thoughts or fears that pop into my head. For instance, if I have a headache and I begin to have anxiety that the headache may signal some sort of scary, underlying health condition, I will tell my husband about it and about the fear. Lately, I’ve been doing this a lot more than normal. By telling him, I know that I’m looking for him to soothe my fears in some way… mostly by telling me it’s likely not something dangerous and it’s simply a headache.

I really, really want to stop sharing these types of anxious thoughts and fears. However, somehow I feel like if I don’t share them then perhaps they will come true or that my anxiety about them simply will not diminish until someone gives me reassurance.

Have you ever dealt with this issue? How did you manage to stop oversharing? Obviously “just don’t seek reassurance” is easier said than done. Do you have any tricks that allowed you to face the anxiety related to the thoughts without reassurance seeking?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iss8dt/how_can_i_stop_sharing_so_much_and_seeking/,bluelovely87,1739925562.0,anxiety

1582,"“It” doesn’t get out of hand, you do","This may not sound very sympathetic, but when it came to my own health anxiety which I finally overcame, not seeing my symptoms as an “it” that was happening to me through some unseen force, but rather a reaction by my body to my own reaction, to my own perception and apprehension, was a game changer. 

We’re not talking blame here, mind you. You certainly don’t want to beat yourself up about it or get frustrated and bewildered. Seeing it as bad and terrible that you let it affect you is counterproductive and brings on more anxiety. It’s a skill. It’s sure as hell is not easy. Sometimes you can’t help feeling uneasy or scared, but by not giving it too much thought or effort or struggle trying to make it go away, you can change how you view it in general at first and then you can actually reduce its effects when it’s happening. You learn to see it as not being a big problem, as something you can handle— maybe you don’t see it that way when you are in the middle of it, but the rest of the time, you can more easily accomplish that. That way your subconscious and body slowly catch on. In other words, maybe you can’t help have these scary thoughts and symptoms when you are in the middle of a panic attack, but you can bring it down quite a bit by denying their importance the rest of the time. For me, my anxiety was more of a product of the anxiety I had about symptoms than any other sources of life anxiety. Worrying about anxiety just brought me more anxiety. I stopped saying I had had a “bad” panic attack earlier today” and started thinking “hey I didn’t need to be so scared, I don’t need to be worried about this. I can handle it and push on.” And I had some pretty strong symptoms. I had to tell a nurse in the ER to calm down because she was making me nervous. “You have arrhythmias” she said. I told her “I get them all the time. I’m here as a precaution, relax. Take your time.”",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ismfb4/it_doesnt_get_out_of_hand_you_do/,vmtz2001,1739909738.0,anxiety

1584,"Solutions to My Panic Attacks, Anxiety, and Depression","I just want to put this out there in case it can help others.  I've had 5 therapists, tried multiple medications, read self help books and watched tons of videos trying to find answers.  I'm finally making big progress on my anxiety, and it has boiled down to a couple things for me.

**FEAR OF FEAR** and **RESISTANCE** to ""having to do things"" like work, chores, etc.  Read below for details and suggested ways to resolve this.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had my first panic attack during Covid when I worried about dying.  Ever since I have been in a constant state of anxiety, panic attacks, and depression.  As far as I can tell, having that first panic attack reduced my anxiety threshold and put me on alert to anxiety because I ""didn't want to feel like that again.""  So I became hyper vigilant of anxiety to fight it, which is exactly what perpetuates it.  So instead of being able to take lets say 60% of the sensation of anxiety, it dropped to something like 20% because I was so watchful of it.  Then anytime it gets close to 20%, it would shoot up to maximum and cause panic attacks because I *thought I couldn't handle it.*  Just knowing that this is what has been happening has reduced my anxiety by a ton.

Next, it's like that panic attack and brush with death awakened something in me and broadened my perspective.  There were so many things I hadn't really worried about before that suddenly seemed to be colossal problems.  Aging, death, and the general impermanence of life that had previously felt so permanent.  My mind looked too far into the future and worried about everything at once.  Time and coming to terms with a lot of this has reduced my anxiety, but one big thing was left.  It felt like there was a mountain of things to do ahead of me.  I wasn't focusing on the day at hand, but on a mental image of the rest of my entire life and I felt forced into doing meaningless tasks for the rest of my time here.

I finally realized it's a choice.  Instead of resisting what needs to be done, I tell myself that I choose to do it.  I choose to go to work, shower, prepare meals, live, feel emotions, and everything in between.  This concept for me comes from the Albert Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus book where Sisyphus is cursed to carry a boulder up a mountain over and over for eternity.  The book also talks about the absurd, which is essentially man's search for meaning in a meaningless world.  Sisyphus who is the analogous absurd hero, therefore is what we should strive for. Being aware of the absurd, one should not opt out of life.  It is the ‘supreme form of consciousness’ when we know our rocks will keep rolling back, but we choose to be superior to our fate and go back to carry it up each time.

So choose to do what feels forced on you instead of resisting it.  It brings acceptance and peace.  Also realize that fear of anxiety and panic causes more of it.  I'm still working at it myself, but these two key points have dropped my anxiety drastically.  I think all it will take is practice now on having the right mindset.  I'm in the process of coming off my Zoloft as well.

1585,Politically terrified of the future - how to distract myself?,"Hey everyone, 

I unfortunately have no idea where to post this, and I still hope that someone here can possibly help me.

I'm from Germany, 39 years old, and hold a master's degree in Business Informatics (though I guess that's rather irrelevant here). 

The current political developments in the US, Russia, China, and Europe are causing me immense anxiety. It feels like we're speeding full steam ahead towards war. Across Europe, right-wing and even Nazi-sympathizing parties are celebrating successes. Everywhere you turn, you hear this disgusting authoritarian tone demanding the suppression of queer people, trans people, women, people of color, and foreigners in general. 

Personally, I dream of a united and open-minded Europe. Furthermore, glancing across the pond to the US almost daily fills me with despair. At times, it's incredibly disheartening to feel like the American population is indifferent to the fact that their democracy is being eroded piece by piece. Maybe my perception is skewed, but that's the impression I get. 

It terrifies me to think that Russia, with its backward and regressive worldview, might prevail, especially as it appears that the Americans are now sounding the same alarm bells. 

The reason I'm turning to you is twofold: firstly, I feel utterly alone with this fear, and secondly, if I'm not alone, how can I learn to cope with it?

- I believed god was guiding me and would walk 9 hrs per day in a heat wave while my feet where bleeding to a church. Bcs I believed people where out to hurt me and god was going to protect me. This lasted around a month.
- I believed aliens were outside my house telling me I was one of them and that I needed to end my life to be safe and happy. This lead me to shave my eyebrows off and try to become alien like in appearance wearing black out contacts and space boots.
- I believed something was inside me and that I needed to kill my insides by taking pills or bleach to kill it. (I just took pills and ended up in hospital)

1592,need advice or if anyone can relate!!!,"I feel like people who have PMDD might understand this more than most, but I'm really struggling and just need to get this off my chest.
My PMDD got significantly worse after my mom passed away five years ago. Then COVID hit, and it felt like a perfect storm. Not long after my mom died, my dad started dating someone new very quickly. Around the same time, my boyfriend developed an alcohol problem and became emotionally abusive. I was grieving, completely alone, and had no emotional support from family. Living through a global pandemic only made everything feel more unstable and unsafe.

 I stayed in that relationship until 2022, knowing I had to leave. When I finally did, I was left with severe PTSD and anxiety. I had to move out of the apartment we shared in LA, and my dad (who has always been somewhat absent) helped me move some things. I've been independent since I was 18-never into drugs, always responsible-but my mental health was at an all-time low. My dad knew about my struggles with PMDD and told me I could stay at his house.
Four months later, out of nowhere, his wife decided I had to leave. My dad framed it as me needing to find a place, but it was obvious she wanted me gone. My PTSD kicked in full force I had just been fired a week before from a toxic job at the time, before from a toxic job at the time, barely had any money, and had no stable plan. My dad said he would help me, but I was essentially forced to move into a place with a roommate. I got a different job, but I never felt comfortable there, and my mental health kept declining. My new boss then said I couldn't work part time and had to take some time to work on my mental health because I called out twice in two months for my pmdd. So l've been looking for work that I can function with. I just feel so lost and like my life is falling apart.
And the feeling of my family not being there in an adequate way is breaking me. I don't wanna live with my dad but it would make so much sense he has so many empty rooms and he's well off I could actually just get it together and this wouldn't keep happening. UGH Now my lease is ending, and my dad has made it clear he won't be a guarantor for another apartment. I don't have enough saved to get a place on my own, and I don't want to sign another lease right now. My dad and his wife have a six-bedroom house, but he refuses to let me stay there. every day is a struggle  My aunt (who has a five-bedroom house) initially said I could live with her, but this morning she changed her mind, saying she just wants her home to herself. I get it, but I feel so lost-I just need a safe place to get on my feet. Im always respectful clean working and have lived on my own for 13 years and need a safe space to work on myself and grieve my mom's death. I need to just feel safe and get this figured out. I have no close family left. 

My dad has helped me financially in small ways (he paid off a credit card but said I have to pay him back), but no amount of money replaces actual support. I've tried everything-I've been on seven different SSRis, I go to therapy, I work out, I am trying. But it feels impossible to make progress when I have no stability. I just feel so abandoned, and it's devastating knowing my own family could help but won't. I don't know what to do.

1597,Medication Treatments for GAD,"Hi everyone! First off thanks for taking the time to read. I'm a 29y/o data center technician that unfortunately suffers from intense GAD. Last year with work insurance I finally started the journey of getting treated for it. 

First I was prescribed Duloxetine for anxiety and Adderall for ADHD. The Duloxetine gave me horrible mood swings and wasn't effective. My psych then prescribed me Escitalopram which I did find effective to help regulate the dread and worry that comes with GAD.

1599,At my wits end,"Mainly a rant, but happy to hear from anyone who commiserate 

I was diagnosed Bipolar 2 about three years ago, but I was originally diagnosed GAD with subsequent ocd tendency about 15 years ago. 

I didn't really want to consider meds until I was diagnosed bipolar, as my symptoms became unbearable. 

Thing is, I have yet to find a single med in three years that hasn't just made things worse. 

Seroquel made me sleep 15 hrs a day
Abilify made my skin feel like it was buzzing and I was getting confused all the time
SSRIs haven't helped at all
Trazadone helps me sleep, but that's about it.

I've gained about 60lbs since starting the med journey.

Now, I've been on buspar for about a month, and I haven't slept in like 4 days, my HR is all over the place, and it feels like my skin is vibrating. I'm more irritable than I am without meds (probably due to lack of sleep).

I'm just so tired of this.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iso27u/at_my_wits_end/,Delicious-Lemon-1897,1739913639.0,anxiety
1600,How do I manage anxiety by myself?,"I was in therapy for a few years, I just recently quit because my therapist said I was doing well enough to handle things on my own. I was not in therapy specifically for anxiety and I just discovered a month ago that I had it through reddit. I told the symptoms so many times to so many therapists/psychologists since I was 13 years old, but they never really helped or told me that I had anxiety or something similar. Just gave me some distraction techniques like counting to 100. Some meds they gave me for adhd even made it 1000 times worse and I got anxiety attacks, but they just told me to up the dose.

My therapist told me, since I am able to leave the house again and go to school regularly I am doing fine. But it got worse again. I can still leave the house, but everything around me overwhelms me, my body feels horrible, like something really horrible is about to happen to me at any moment. Every possible future scenario that I think about makes my stomach burn like fire because I feel like I can't handle it and something horrible is going to happen. I can't sit down in peace for even a minute and I can't fall asleep without distracting myself from my thoughts by watching something.

So I started meditating 10 minutes a day because I heard it is really helpful. The first time was awesome, It made me cry and I felt pretty good afterwards. But since then I can't really focus, I feel like I don't know what to do with my thoughts and I get distracted all the time so all I do is sit down and worry. I tried some apps, but they wanted subscriptions to continue.

Now I am not sure what exactly to do to help calm down this horrible feeling in my chest. I do not want to go to therapy again, it wasn't very helpful and going there was also extremely stressful, so I want to take this journey on my own. I just do not know where to start. I know I can do it, I do not doubt that I can't live a normal life again.

1602,First day on Buspirone (Spitomin) and I feel like death,"Today I started Spitomin 5mg x2 morning and night. I was already scared bc I have horrible health anxiety and emetophobia. Took it with food. The first hour was completely fine, I was a bit anxious as expected, but I didn't feel dizzy or anything. I went outside after, had my regular amount of anxiety. Went about my day, with my regular waves of anxiety.

Around 5-6h after my dose the anxiety started coming in a lot stronger, specifically with nausea, high heartrate, a couple more hours in a headache started coming on, and the nausea was getting worse. 

Obviously, I started checking reddit for more info, which wasn't a good idea, but I was having a massive adrenaline rush. 

I decided to split my tablet and take it just now (10ish hours after first dose) with food and continue to take it 3x per day instead. 

Do you guys think this was some type of withdrawal or like ""rebound"" anxiety? Of course I should contact my psychiatrist about this, but it costs 40€ and would take like a week to get the appointment.

TL;DR: 10h ago I took 5mg with food and felt normal-ish, but after 5+h it started getting worse, then a headache that kept worsening, and genuine nausea. Could this be some type of withdrawal?

1606,Klonopin— how much is ok?,"hi friends.

i’m 24F diagnosed with GAD, PTSD, PMDD, panic disorder, and depression! yay! in therapy and medicated. also underwent TMS treatment. 

anyway, i take .5mg of klonopin maybe once a week, sometimes less, on days when it gets bad. usually its trigger related (ie traveling, change in routine, PTSD episode, or when im getting my period)

there’s exceptions, ofc. for example, if im traveling i may take it a few days in a row, or if im doing really well ill go a few weeks without it. i never go above .5mg in one dosage.

my question is… is this too frequent? i know benzodiazepines are extremely addicting and im not sure if im over doing it, or if im using the medication properly to help manage my anxiety. 

i love the way klonopin nips my anxiety in the bud, but it also leaves me horribly “hung over” the next day (exhausted)— which makes me choosy about when i decide to take it.

a small added context is that i am NOT at my worst. my SSRIs help me IMMENSELY, and allow me to generally function. if im not medicated, i am agoraphobic and have severe physical panic 24/7. i am blessed my meds help me exist, but sometimes i need a little boost… (the klonopin)

Sometimes, when I'm telling a truth or confession of something, or when I'm directly trying to persuade someone on shaky grounds, I can feel a physical sensation that lasts for only a moment. It's like the moment it comes out of my mouth, the world spins on its axis violently, I become hypertense, and there's an electric trill that goes from my brain to my feet. It's instantaneous, lasts only a second or two, and there are no outward physical changes. My eyes don't look away. My body doesn't stiffen or change. It just is electrocuted without pain and gives severe onset vertigo. I don't know what it is because it's not a panic attack, and the only lingering side effects are that I will be incredibly flustered afterwards (although I'm very good at hiding it as no one has ever commented.)

It's like the universe is making a damn speech check, and it happens when I succeed or manage to get the words out. 

For background, I have had years of therapy, acute OCD, and Major Depressive Disorder. With the only history in my family for this kind of stuff being my mom has epilepsy.

1617,How would u deal with ostracism/exclusion?,"*Decided to rant here as I am unable to sleep well for many weeks as I kept thinking about everything that has happened and feeling hurt about things that happened last year and some drama happened again after my CCA friends become affiliated to the same group.*

A group from my CCA I used to play games with before exchange become much closer after I got back from exchange. During my exchange, I was in severe depression (and suicidal) and had no support system and had opened up to a friend from this group. However, he repeatedly ignored my messages and had replied “trust me I know what it feels like to be ignored, but the more u pester me, the more I don’t want to reply u”. I was hurt and angry as I had felt that as a friend, I would have been more understanding and avoid doing the things that trigger/hurt my friends, and have mutually agreed to not text each other but don’t mind playing games together when I get back. When I got back, the group had become much closer and had even created an unofficial group from the CCA. However, because they played games at unofficial hours, I had stopped joining.

Fast forward 1 year, several members from the group invited me to join the session, telling me that he is not around (I did not tell them that we were not on good terms but figured he told them). I thought to give it a try, considering I used to play with them and it does seem nice belonging to a clique. However, I later found out from a mutual friend that I was not welcome back because “someone was not comfortable with playing with me” and knew it was this guy. I messaged him privately to clarify politely if he had talked behind my backs and he said no. However, I later received a sarcastic message from my friend who was mad at me confronting him. I told him to stop complaining about me to her. He clarified that he did not do so but he had posted in the unofficial group *“srsly can we not make this whole XX thing some big drama fest. Idk which one of u he msged, but i alr made it clear I not comfortable with him. Idw make this bigger than it has to be. Pls respect my boundaries can or not. Thanks.""* demanding the members not to invite me and to respect his boundaries and he does not want any drama. I understand if he chooses not to play with me and wants his friends to respect that decision. However, I felt that he was forcing his boundaries onto everyone by demanding them to not invite me.

After he posted that series of message, because it was so extreme, I felt that people would just assume I did something horrible to him when he said he was simply just not comfortable playing with me as we hadn’t talked to each other for a long time since I got back. I didn’t actively avoid him or give him the cold shoulder, I just didn’t proactively talk to him. Furthermore, I rarely saw him in-person since I stopped going for those sessions. I had also sincerely apologised for opening up to him about my depression and that it may have been too overwhelming for him. However, I told him I was not okay with him posting that series of message in the group chat and forcing his boundaries onto everyone. He then blocked me.

This incident had caused me to fall back into depression and my general anxiety disorder has worsened a lot as I can’t help but worry about what members thought about me after seeing his series of message to not invite me would have thought about me and likely assumed I did something horrible to him considering how extreme it is to post that in the group chat. However, because I was not in the group chat, there was absolutely no way for me to clarify it as it would be super weird of me to randomly message them about this (considering I’m not supposed to even know about him posting them). My depression and anxiety got so bad then that I had wanted to take a Leave of absence (LOA) but decided not to at the end as I had already taken an LOA for a semester prior.

That week, I was extremely afraid to go to my CCA to play as I did not know what will happen and was worried about what people thought about me. My friend (not involved in the drama) reassured me that I was just overthinking. However, the worst thing happened, when the moment I entered the room and sat on the table beside them (because there was no other place to sit, I avoided looking at them and even sat at the seat furthest from them), he, followed by his 2 friends left the room immediately. Other members who I used to be okay with (including the ones who invited me) seemed afraid to interact with me since then.This incident hurt me a lot, and I was quite traumatised by it.

Since then, I had always been paranoid and extremely insecure about it. Recently, I had asked to join dinner with 2 mutual friends, one of which was friends with the guy’s close friend (who had left the room with him). I have never interacted with him prior and had not bothered to interact with him after the incident where he had left the room with that guy. However, I decided to give the benefit of doubt and tell myself I’m just overthinking by asking my friend if I could join them for dinner. Yet again, the worst happens, and I was rejected to join them for dinner. Once again, I felt extremely hurt and went into “crisis” mode. It was so uncomfortable because I kept worrying about what gossips may have spread about me and could not even play with my other friends who were not involved in the drama anymore. This was also why I felt so insecure when the two new friends I made stopped inviting me for dinner which led to the whole drama and ban after I told them I was unhappy about it.

Looking back, I understand that I have overreacted at certain points and could definitely have improved on how I communicated and reacted to ostracism/exclusion.

1638,"Do I have bad anxiety, should I get medicated for it?","So here are some reasons I think I might have bad anxiety, which I’ve never considered (cus I don’t have panic attacks) until recently after being on Wellbutrin for some months:

- Still thinking about how I wasn’t paying attention at self-checkout line yesterday so a worker had to clap in my face, and another person tapped me from behind to go to the open kiosk. Why do I ruminate on inconsequential things for so long, thinking; why can’t I always do things right? When that’s an impossible standard to set for yourself.

- Whenever I’m in public, I think about not being clumsy and perfecting my movements a lot, cus I think everyone is paying attention to me. Which just isn’t true. People are preoccupied with their own lives, and I try convincing myself to not be a narcissistic loser constantly.

- My mind goes blank when conversing with people often, cus I start thinking about what I look like from their perspective when making full eye-contact. (I’m expecting to probably be drowned in narcissist allegations in the replies to this post.)

- Thought I had cavities and might even need a root canal for months to a year, which made me anxious to schedule my yearly dentist appointment. That caused tartar build up on my teeth, thus I became more conscious about having bad breath when I speak to people. And whenever I wasn’t chewing gum, my possible bad breath is all I could think about. I would tend to mumble or not enunciate properly, to keep my mouth as closed as possible to not let my ‘stank’ breath escape. Then finally got to dentist (thank you 300mg XL), and they told me I had no cavities, and just removed the tartar.

- I developed a habit of correcting even the most minor mistakes in text messages, so I don’t look stupid.

- Anytime I’m having a convo or trying to build a relationship with someone more attractive than me, I automatically think they know they’re more superior in a way to me, so it’s hard to completely be myself. Off the liquor tho, let’s just say if I was an alcoholic I’d be leading a cult right now.

- I’m afraid to compliment straight attractive men, cus I don’t want them to assume I’m hitting on them.

- My acne makes me not want to work any sort of 1:1 customer service job, cus I think people will be disgusted by me, and that combined with any sort of upset by my doing = my self-worth plummeting even more.

Not sure if I’m crazy, just constantly over-exaggerating, or severely mentally ill. Men used to go to war (I’m 20M btw) and here I am ruminating about these silly things.

It’s happening again but the anxiety is tenfold this time. I legitimately can’t safely do my job because of the panic attacks. 

So I’ve told myself to take a little medical
Leave- start with a week and go from there. (Yes I have a dr appointment this week). 

But everybody always says avoidance is the worse thing you can do. I don’t know if it’s work that’s causing my anxiety (frankly I wake up with it) but I do know that I am avoiding it until I can control my panic- otherwise I’m going to self sabotage myself once again by constantly calling in sick strictly due to anxiety. 

In my mind I think I know that a little break is what’s best for me. Normally I take this break and eventually bounce back to my normal self.

I’ve always had terrible horrible anxiety but this is the first time it’s finally sent me to the ER. I got a 4 day prescription for Ativan and made a telehealth appointment with dr in the meantime until I could get in to a PCP at least. 
 

Ativan helps, a lot. Hydroxyzine, what the telehealth Dr prescribed, gave me a super low heart rate and heart palpitations, on top of only sleeping 4 hours, and I had a fucking terrible day. The anxiety came back, I got frustrated at my room mate, I laid in the bed for way too long which made me worried about blood clots. I worried about how I don’t have a job. I worried about my cats in general. I worried and worried and panicked and had a low heart rate somehow still bc of the hydroxyzine, which freaked me out. The snow is gonna ruin my chances of getting a different prescription. What the fuck. 

I finally took one of the 3 Ativan I had left after the Hydroxyzine wore off. So now I have two. PCP appointment is on Thursday, but it’s supposed to snow a shitload on Wednesday. I had such a terrible day. How am I supposed to live like this. I am such a shit show. Even with the Ativan right now, I feel better, but still. My chest hurts from rubbing it so much.

1651,How do people deal with upset stomach from anxiety.,"I’m 24, I’ve had anxiety since I gained consciousness and I could start remembering things. 

I remember starting kindergarten and my stomach would be in absolute knots in the morning. I’d feel like I’m either going to be sick, or have to use the bathroom. It was something every week, but my parents just assumed I was lying because I didn’t want to go. 

It never really stopped, I just stopped telling them about it. And it did change, it went from getting nauseous or getting sick to something else. 

The anxiety shits. 

Every goddamn morning before school, at school, at the worst possible time - the anxiety shits. 

How can I tell the difference between normal going to the bathroom and the anxiety being the cause? Urgency. The anxiety I’d be feeling at that moment. When you know, you know. 

I thought surely, this will end at some point. I’ll get used to it, and I won’t be stuck in the bathroom every time I experience some anxiety. Here I am, 24 years old, dealing with the same *anxiety shits* I got when I was in high school. All because I have to sign for a package my husband ordered. 

I swear, my anxiety goes straight to my stomach. I thought maybe if I stopped all caffeine consumption, I’d feel better. Maybe if I cut out some things in my diet, I’ll feel better. No. Instead I was anxious and miserable. No will to live without my morning Celsius water packet or coffee, and still just as anxious. I’m sure for some people, caffeine makes it worse. I have never noticed a difference. It doesn’t make it better if I cut it out, it doesn’t make it worse if I continue consuming it. 

I know I’m not the only one that has this happen. I’m trying to see a psychiatrist, soon, hopefully. I might get an appointment in at some point in my lifetime. 

Will anxiety medication help with this? Am I stuck with this problem, forever? Do I bring up this problem, specifically, or can I just describe the anxiety/answer their questions and have some sort of dignity without explaining I have the anxiety shits. I can anonymously admit I have the problem, but face to face? Just kill me instead.

for example: a few weeks ago i had burned my tongue with soup, and the morning after i had forgetten about it, so when my breakfast felt weird against my tongue i freaked out for hours about a possibly reaction, because why else would my tongue be so red and painful? i felt embarassed when i remember the soup. theres too many examples i have to list here honestly

the globus sensation doesnt help either..it comes and goes lately, especially when im eating…and im terrified of choking and anaphylaxis.

1653,How to help a partner who experiences anxiety differently from me?,"I (20) have experienced anxiety from a very young age. I was lucky enough that my parents let me see a therapist starting in middle school, and I’ve been semi regularly going to therapy ever since. It helped a lot. I recently got put on Zoloft as well, and I feel like a whole new person. While I still struggle with anxiety, I feel like I’ve got it under control. My partner (20) has not been so lucky, though. They only recently started going to therapy. It’s had some mixed results. They also got put on an SSRI with some weird side effects. When they tried switching, their doctor told them to just go cold turkey. No wind down from the old meds. They had some pretty crazy withdrawal.

All of this is to say that my partner has anxiety attacks, and I don’t. I used to have them, but that’s a bit of a distant memory at this point. I do my best to help them practice all the typical grounding techniques and provide them love and reassurance, but it seems like the things that used to help me don’t help them.

For example, my anxiety attacks would usually center around some singular thought. “My friends hate me.” “I’m gonna flunk out of school.” “My dad is going to kill me.” Stuff like that. And I would take that thought and logic it out. “My friends haven’t been acting any differently.” “I still have a B in this class.” “My dad doesn’t even know about this.” That would stop me from spiraling and catastrophising. It certainly wouldn’t make the feeling go away, but it would stop it from getting worse. Of course, the anxious part of my brain would fight back, “what if they’re not telling me they hate me because they don’t want me to know?” But I would always be able to logic my way out of it.

My partner has similar experiences, where they’ll have an anxious thought and spiral out about it completely. The difference is they’re not asking themselves “what if I get fired?” They’re saying “I’m getting fired. I have been fired. It is already done.” No amount of talking and reasoning will convince them otherwise. No matter what I say, they fully and genuinely believe that their boss can see into their head or break the law without consequence to fire them. It won’t become clear to them that this isn’t true until hours later. Sometimes it even takes days. 

While I understand anxiety isn’t based on logic, I don’t understand how it makes them fully believe things they normally know aren’t true. I have always had some level of awareness that my anxious thoughts aren’t based in reality, and I’ve found that comforting. My partner does not.

How do I calm them down when there’s nothing I can do or say that will convince them that they are safe?

TLDR: My partner fully believes the worst is going to happen, no matter what, even if it is not actually possible. How do I help them?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1isgsw0/how_to_help_a_partner_who_experiences_anxiety/,Asking9876543210,1739896389.0,anxiety

1657,Need something new,"Hi! I have been dealing with anxiety for as long as i can remember but then developed really bad panic disorder about 4 ish years ago. I have been off and on prozac and take hydroxizene for my bad panic attacks.  

Prozac i have taken on and off through the years and trying different MG's but all feel like it wasn't doing anything or much. I haven't been on anything for roughly eight months but the last 2 months have been an awful time with anxiety. Its the smallest things like going to a movie theater or going to my friends house. & i dont suffer with social anxiety so its super confusing and i get worked up! 

This never was the case before. I will say i haven't been having panic attacks but due to these events its causing me to take my hydroxizene more than usual just so i can get through things but it makes me sooo sleepy. 

Tomorrow I have an appointment to go over medication and see what new daily medication plan is best.

I was wondering what medication has been the most helpful  for those who maybe felt similarly? I am open to anything just weight gain is a side effect id like steer clear due to my PCOS. ",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1isgf3y/need_something_new/,FinePapaya4546,1739895457.0,anxiety

1661,"Looking for a suspect, any suspect","If this doesn’t apply to you, disregard. When you are hypochondriacal the way I was, you will look for any cause other than your own catastrophic fantasizing that is giving your erroneous beliefs more fuel and legitimacy. It’s my credit card debt not my own suggestion, it’s a calcium deficiency, excessive cortisol, all my anxiety attacks have damaged my heart, I can’t leave my house, can’t go up hills, cloudy days will make me panic, it’s my divorce, it’s my childhood. I’ve heard it all. I’ve been chiming in about this online and giving people pointers through DM for the past 7 years. And yes, it’s not always what I call the SIPS, self induced psychosomatic symptoms. Some people have genuine medical and psychological conditions that cause anxiety in a more bonafide way. Don’t get me wrong, synptoms are real, just not always a genuine medical condition. But it just might be that you are hypochondriacal the way I was barking up the wrong tree all through the 90’s all because I was focusing too much on finding a medical or emotional cause and solution and not enough on a change of my own perceptions and self talk. It’s not just about relaxing, weighted blankets, forgiving those who have hurt you, finding closure, avoiding anxiety- producing situations, taking something to calm down, reducing stress in your life, eating healthy, getting negative people out of your life, getting therapy, blamimg it on other sources of anxiety in your life. It’s not so much about anxiety, it’s more about beliefs. Some of these things we seek to do are necessary as support measures, but they are in my opinion and the opinion of many experts, not the main culprit when it comes to anticipatory health anxiety. Worrying to much about anxiety can actually be your anxiety. Telling yourself you must avoid being anxious because your body will react is setting yourself up. You can tell yourself it doesn’t have to be thst way. Anxiety is a part of life. This is a problem with beliefs and self talk, and what triggers it happens not so much during a panic attack as before and after, with your general day in day out self talk and beliefs. During a panic attack, it’s better not to do anything, to avoid struggling…as much as possible, bc sometimes you do need a little help. I understood the concepts with self talk,hypervigelence well. I knew it was my own suggestion. I just didn’t know what it meant to tolerate it and not struggle and to stop obsessing. You don’t accept it, you tolerate it. You don’t overcome a panic attack by suggesting your way out of it or trying too hard to reassure yourself, nor do I recommend  you frantically try to get distracted. Leave the whole matter for later, put it aside for now to allow it to settle itself down,  You even leave alone that frantic yucky feeling that you need do something to feel differently. You go neutral and let yourself naturally get distracted, allowing the feeling of anxiety and the sensations to be there, but without daydreaming about it or getting into an inner dialogue with  it. Your mind will want to snap back to the topic every now and then, but  you calmly nudge it away. You neither indulge in it or run away from it. The comforting light at the end of the tunnel is remembering how you feel when your mind has drifted on to something else and you realize it’s all gone. They say to stay in the present and yeah don’t go off on a what if fantasy, but it’s also good to expect and look forward to that pay off in the very near future, knowing it will work itself out once you are no longer paying attention to it. Over time, you will learn to program your mind to naturally seek that recovery to come faster and with milder symptoms until symptoms are a minor curiosity to you as they are to me now. Oh and you can overcome this entirely for years, I just fell back into it when I started revisiting this topic. No biggie. Avoid sentimental negativity or grieving in all this. Think positive, stay confident and cocky. No moping. That’s my advice. Watch what you tell yourself. No, “I hope so.” You know so. It’s all a product of your beliefs anyway and you decide what you believe. Never mlnd what you feel or the momentary thoughts that pop in your head. Let your beliefs lead the way.

1663,Attack on SSRIs and evidence-based treatment?,"TLDR: The administration is undermining evidence-based mental health support. Call your members of Congress and tell your advocacy organization to stand up.

 ---

I have anxiety: in particular, OCD. Years ago, I was spiraling. I was scared and confused. I genuinely didn’t know if I was going to make it. Today, my anxiety is under control and most days I don’t even think about it.

Three things helped. First, when my anxiety was at its debilitatingly worst, I was prescribed an SSRI. This was a game-changer. I told my wife that it felt like the first time I put on glasses and saw what people with “normal” eyesight see. Except instead of clarifying my eyesight, it clarified my mind. This allowed me to pull back from the brink and do the hard work of ERP.

Second, of course, is the ERP itself. We know this is the “gold standard” for this particular kind of anxiety treatment.

Third, is the information I could find online that led me to a qualified therapist and helped me understand what was happening in my brain and how to address it. Much of that information came from places like Reddit and the many other amazing online and in-person anxiety communities (no reassurance-seeking!). Much of it came from reliable institutional sources.

But the institutions and policies that helped make these possible—SSRI access, evidence-based therapy, and quality information—are under attack.

We have the right to make decisions about our own mental health care according to the evidence and in consultation with our medical providers. We know that SSRIs are a critical, evidence-based treatment. But the new Secretary of Health and Human Services has [called people who take SSRIs “addicts”](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/kennedy-rfk-antidepressants-ssri-school-shootings/) and repeated lies such as that SSRIs cause school shootings. The federal government’s new “Make America Healthy Again Commission” [could end up limiting access to SSRIs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/#:~:text=(iii)%C2%A0%20%C2%A0assess%20the%20prevalence%20of%20and%20threat%20posed%20by%C2%A0the%20prescription%20of%20selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitors%2C%20antipsychotics%2C%20mood%20stabilizers%2C%20stimulants%2C%20and%20weight%2Dloss%20drugs%3B).

We have the right to have our money go to quality research projects to develop safe and reliable treatments. But [NIH funding to research organizations has been arbitrarily cut](https://apnews.com/article/trump-academic-research-funding-cuts-lawsuit-nih-fcdad42b9623305dd7ad8db4cff5fc1d). Much of the progress made in anxiety treatment came thanks to NIH funding. Future progress will as well. [Just last fiscal year, the NIH funded 184 projects researching OCD treatments](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/OnXhRz_qIkGxFVzVKbycQQ/projects?fy=2024), including on drugs (like SSRIs), behavioral therapies, and promising emerging treatment approaches. The cits risk shutting these projects down midstream. Research like this isn’t like a car that you can just start and stop. If you interrupt it, you may lose all the progress (and the funding) to date.

We have the right to health information grounded in science. But within just weeks, the new administration has [removed official websites and webpages that contained important health information](https://www.reuters.com/legal/trump-administration-ordered-restore-us-health-agency-websites-that-were-2025-02-11/).

**1. Call your members of Congress and tell them to act to stop the cuts to NIH research funding**. Members of Congress have decided to not fulfill their Constitutionally-mandated duty to provide oversight of federal agencies or advice and consent on government officials. This is part of what has led to the reckless cuts in NIH funding. Our representatives have a responsibility to act on our behalf. Help them remember that and [find contact info for your elected representatives here](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials). The American Psychological Association [has helpful language about the funding cuts you can use during your call if you want](https://www.votervoice.net/APAAdvocacy/Campaigns/121382/Respond).

**2. Tell your advocacy organization to stand up for evidence-based treatment**. I have OCD so my relevant group is the International OCD Foundation. The [IOCDF](https://iocdf.org/) provides crucial resources to people with OCD and helps speak for people impacted by OCD. Years ago, they helped me find a therapist trained in ERP. In case you missed it, they posted [a statement on their website](https://iocdf.org/blog/2025/02/14/iocdf-calls-for-continued-access-to-ssris-in-response-to-executive-order-addressing-youth-health/) calling for continued access to SSRIs in response to the “MAHA Commission” I referenced above. This is important and I thanked the IOCDF for it. If you feel inclined, I encourage you to do the same. But I have not seen a similar statement about the NIH funding and have asked them to speak up like many other mental health organizations, including the [American Psychological Association](https://www.votervoice.net/APAAdvocacy/Campaigns/121382/Respond), have already done. 

**3. Tell your friends, family, and neighbors to do the same**. There is strength in numbers. Who do you know that can speak up with you? Ask them to do so.

1668,How to help persistently invasive anxiety,"

I'm diagnosed with GAD and I've been struggling with it for so long. Having ADHD and depression aswell doesn't help it at all. My entire day is just my mind and body persistently forcing me to feel afraid over the smallest things. And being aware that it's all irrational and you genuinly don't think of that thing in such a nervous way, but your mind is literally invading you with imposed anxiety doesn't help. My mind is 24 7 just a constant back and forth of:

-""worry about this"" 
-""but it's not that serious""
- ""but the way they looked at you"" 
- ""so what if they did"" 
-""its all too convenient you're going to lose it all and they'll hate you and they're all already talking about you etc etc""

(keep in mind all these thoughts are happening all at once, not one by one, with me just trying to silence the anxiety. And this is a very very minor example). 

I'm also in therapy but I haven't gotten much to talking about this enough with my therapist, I plan on doing so. 

This isn't a question for anxiety in general but specifically just constantly feels like my mind and body are trying so hard to force me to be afraid. I know it's because I spent most of my life like this and only recently started *slightly* breaking out of the anxiously expectant fears and expectations but it's still so invasive. It's genuinly an invasive storm all the time in my mind. 

Also, as I've hopefully made clear, I can be very well aware when my (or ""these"") thoughts are so irrational and unnecessary. It's not about me recognizing that. 

Right now I'm struggling with a moment earlier in the day where I stood up for someone. I'm someone who doesn't hesitate to stand up for what I think is right. But it's so bothersome when I do that and then later for the entire weeks or even months it's just my mind being so unbearable.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iserwg/how_to_help_persistently_invasive_anxiety/,heytheretrouble,1739891284.0,anxiety

But I’m not very creative. She mentioned time being one factor to consider, but honestly, other than my nerves being shot and not being able to hold my hand still, I can’t come up with any other criteria.

 And I have sensory issues too so just the ambient background noise of life outside is stressing me the hell out and it just won't stop. I have noise cancelling headphones to help ease this but I can't wear them because I've been told to listen out in case someone knocks on the door today. 

But even something as simple as that, waiting for a knock on the door sends my anxiety crazy, I'm so on edge waiting for it and feel like I can't let my guard down or my focus slip on it at all even for a second. 

My anxiety has been debilitating for a long time. I started seeing a psychologist at around 11 years old and started Prozac at 15. 

It seemed to improve a little then go off the rails even worse than before in the past year. I had to defer my uni placement after only attending for one semester because things were getting dark, I was falling apart and was barely a person nearing the end. Plus I was completely isolated due to intense social anxiety so it was an extremely lonely place which made everything so much harder. 

Now I'm stuck, terrified to do anything, stagnant at home unable to work, unable to attend college. Terrified to even explore my options from here on, I'm so convinced I'm a lost cause incapable of anything, it's hard to even begin to try. 

It's very difficult to access mental health services where I am, particularly for adults. I asked my GP if she could put me in contact with any adult mental health providers or put me on any waiting lists, and after she had me describe how I'd been feeling and how it was affecting my life, she said it would probably be pointless to put me on the waiting lists because it wasn't bad enough, basically. She said the actively suicidal people, people with psychosis or severe schizophrenia, would be the high priority cases and I'd likely be waiting years for help. 

So that was reassuring.

Now I'm seeing a counsellor in training weekly at a non profit organization dedicated to providing support for the mental health of young people. But it honestly hasn't helped much.

1684,Scared to sleep,"Hi! 24F here and I struggle terribly with a panic disorder.

Every night I tend to spiral when I get the tiniest bit tired. I normally will get a bad headache and it will go from there. I always fear that i’m going to die in my sleep. I am in good health, I quite literally have nothing physically wrong with me. It’s all mental.

I recently got diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD. I have been to the hospital 4x for panic attacks in the past 2 months. I even had a CT scan once because I had convinced myself something was wrong with my brain. Obviously nothing was.

Dealing with all this medical anxiety, always thinking something is wrong, has literally ruined me. I am in a constant state of panic and fear. Please if anyone has any advice I could seriously use it. Also, if anyone also struggles with this issue it may help me to not feel so alone. I feel like I am going crazy.

This is my first job in IT and I make good money which I use to pay off my loans and support my parents as well as my long distance relationship. I'm terrified because if I lose this job, finding a job in IT is hard and I don't know if I'll be able to stay afloat. I have a decent amount of savings for my student loans but I can't get over this sick feeling in my stomach. I almost threw up from the stress.

1691,Taken over,"I first started to get anxiety 2 years ago, after being at my friends and feeling un well. I rushed home with head rush, heat, tightening in the throat and didn’t think much of it. All I knew was I needed to get out. The next day I had all those feelings and I couldn’t understand why I felt that way. I was stuck in bed for a week couldn’t eat. The only way I could describe this was feeling possessed because I didn’t know why I was feeling that way and was not in control of it. I remember phoning up my mom crying saying “I don’t know what’s wrong with me” and I don’t ever cry or show emotion like that. 

Over time I just had to deal with it as it was not going. Socialising and keeping my self busy really did help. I now notice that my anxiety is triggered by the thought of feeling un well in a social setting. The littlest thing like going the cinema and it being packed I get a heat rush and all I can think of is I need to get out. Even if I’m out for a meal or eating at a friends I get a heat rush and tight throat sensation before eating. The littlest thing like going the shop or seeing family I think of how I’m gonna feel even though I’m fine. And once I feel hot I spiral. 

I don’t know how to deal with it, like yes i can but does it ever go. I just feel so stupid like you’re going to see family and feeling like I need to go because I don’t feel right. The person I was 2 years ago was so care free now I feel like I’m limited to life. I have good days then bad days but once those bad days come I think of everything coming up making myself nervous but I can’t control it. 

One thing I refuse is meds. I don’t think I’m that bad to be on them anyways but I just don’t have no one to talk to because I feel so silly. No one understands unless you have it and therapy is expensive. So I’m using this platform to speak to people make conversation, talk about anxiety, life, upcoming events and listen to someone who I can relate to.  So if you want general chat or anything put suggestions in the comments or message me I’m open to speak to anyone :)

In the last six months I’ve needed it more frequently than before due to increased stress and panic attacks as in from previously taking it maybe a couple times a week to more days than not. I’ve noticed though when I was needing it more often I would get this terrible cough due to constant need to clear throat feeling like post nasal drip. I chalked it up to allergies and then later with the minimal research I’ve found on this, assuming it may just be reflux due to the medication relaxing the LES, which is responsible for keeping stomach contents from traveling up the esophagus. I would notice my throat would be so irritated and the coughing was driving me crazy. With better anxiety management, I’ve been able to go back to just a couple times a week at most if at all. That confirmed this medication is definitely a trigger because it’s not happening as much. Does anyone struggle with this?! I need to know I’m not crazy.

So for starters I’m F17 and awhile ago (2023) around October I got my first bf, things were going good, but for some reason slowly itd feel really weird after eating?? Like I’d feel super super nauseous but I’d never puke or anything and like when I think about it now I think it’s because always after lunch is when me and him would meet up to walk to class. Within time, like a month, the nausea got so bad I’d dry heave and feel so horrible even when I wasn’t with him or friends or at school, before it got bad I was a good averaging 115 pounds and I lost nearly 16 pounds in a week from this, that’s how quickly it went bad and all the hospitals I went to told me I was probably sick or it was anxiety which I just agreed to because it honestly could’ve been (but why did it last so long and constantly??) a week or two after the dry heaving started and I wasn’t able to even walk to my bus stop from it me and the bf broke up because he didn’t like not seeing me in person. I eventually started feeling better even being able to go out after a few months. But I can sometimes feel the sickness feeling when I get too excited over something or I see this guy specifically. Like a few weeks ago I saw him in a store I was at and had to absolutely leave because I felt so nauseous and disgusted, and just today he for some odd reason added me on an online platform and my stomach dropped seeing the name (as it always does) and I was talking about what to do if I should accept or not to a friend and I just literally start shivering but not because I’m cold but like I guess.. scared???

1707,I really need help controlling my anxiety.,"I (25 F) recently started having weird feelings that I could not describe around 6 months ago. I would have random episodes multiple times a day where I would feel light-headed or that I was about to pass out. I continued to ignore those sensations until they started to affect my day-to-day life. I was unable to do anything without being in fear that I was going to faint. The sensation of fainting was accompanied by my body getting really hot and shaky. I went and sought help after having a breakdown in front of my family. I was prescribed medication, but have seen little to no improvement. 

Cut to today, my anxiety is at its peak when I’m driving. I get a feeling that I’m going to lose consciousness and only feel comfortable if I know I have an “escape route.” For example, today I was driving home from work and stopped at a red light, i could not turn right due to a one way street, and being that I live in a bigger city all the spots on the side of the road were taken so I couldn’t pull over. That sent me into almost a full panic that did not go away until I was in motion again, making progress towards my destination. This sometimes happens at work or in public spaces as well. It’s almost like I zone out and feel the ground moving under me, that’s when I get the feeling that I’m going to pass out (though I never actually have), then I begin to panic and feel like I need to find a “safe space” alone to calm down. Sometimes my vision even gets weird, sometimes I feel a weird sensation that I am not in control of my own body if that makes any sense. Also, I get headaches whenever this happens to me. The only time I don’t feel these sensations is when I’m “safe” at home for the night. 

I want to know what I could do to help alleviate these symptoms. Especially because I have a job that requires me to interact with people in the office a lot. 

Keep in mind, this has never been an issue for me before. I used to be extremely out going. I used to go to the gym 5x a week, now I’m too afraid to even go due to the fact that I’ve had that sensation during work outs. I used to purposely go on long drives to relax, now I do whatever I can to avoid driving. This has all come up within the last 6 months. I just want to go back to how I used to feel.

1709,Shall I move from England to NYC?,"Hi there

I’m 28 and live in London. 3 years ago I asked if I could transfer to NYC with work as I was feeling stagnant in my job and life, and I’ve been waiting to hear back for all this time with constant let downs and delays. About 6 months ago, I had an anxious breakdown over my health (there is nothing wrong with my health) which creeped into all aspects of my life and has really affected me mentally. I always felt I was a very strong and capable person and a survivor, but now have a lot of doubt and fear over basic things. I don’t understand why this happened and feel that I might never, but am in therapy to try and deal with it.

Work told me out of the blue on Friday that my offer for NYC has (after all this time) been finalised, and asked if I can emigrate and start in 5 weeks. I am absolutely terrified, upset, and really stressed. I’ve just been trying to get through each day as it comes on my road to recovery and have not had the capacity to think about new opportunities or a new life. I don’t want to throw this opportunity away which I’ve wanted for so long but I’m scared if I go that I’ll have no support system, make no friends due to my anxiety and just hate the experience. I want to find the strength to be able to say yes but it’s all so overwhelming and I don’t know if I’m strong enough to do it.

1710,Nightly Panic Attacks,"In 2022 I got the stomach bug and I didn’t think it affected me that much until about 7 months later I started to feel sick and I entered a full blown panic attack over it. Like crying in the shower, screaming I don’t want to die, arm going numb, hyperventilating, ended up at the ER type panic attack.

When I think back, that attack was way more traumatic than when I was sick (and yet if you ask me, I’d still choose that over being sick?!) 

Anyway, after that my contamination OCD took off! Fearful about eating anything. Fearful about getting sick. 

AND every single night ends in anxiety. 

I’ve been in CBT therapy for years for this. It’s mellowed out but I don’t think I’m anywhere close to where I want to be. 

I’ve made strides with my emetaphobia and OCD but I still have anxiety attacks almost every single night and it’s a full body experience. It’s like my body knows it’s time to sleep and I start twitching and breathing rapidly, feeling hot and sick, etc. it’s horrible. And there’s no core thought I can pinpoint. My mind is not racing? I’m just overcome with unexplainable fear.

1711,Anyone else struggle with travel?,"Hi folks! We really want to be able to book a holiday soon (my husband especially) and we’ve enjoyed several holidays in our time. However, I get very anxious and panicky about being away from home. I always have and I don’t really know what it is about being away that makes me so unsettled. 

I had a few successful trips with no panic attacks but our last trip away I had a panic attack the first night (it’s always night time that things take a turn) and now I’m worried about being away again. I feel panicky just thinking about it. I know I’ll probably feel better once I’m there but I wish I could JUST be excited and not feel any panic/anxiety about it. I have lots of “what ifs?” like what if I need help while I’m there? What if someone back home is poorly? What if I need to go home? So on and so forth. I was also a child who couldn’t stay away from home without crying. 

Does anyone else get like this? I also feel so bad for my partner who is a keen traveller and I don’t want to piss on his parade!

Ultimately, I go back and forth on whether there’s something else to be addressed, maybe agoraphobia but I don’t struggle with going out any other time so I think it’s unlikely. Has anyone else been the same and found a fix? I just want to be able to enjoy a holiday with my husband and I am finding myself worried about even booking one.

It’s been 2 years since my anxiety started. I figured it was anxiety from pain in center of my chest, feeling anxious and scared all day and high bp(190/100). Had few sessions with psychologist, which helped with me not being anxious all day and bp is better. But for last year I have palpitations on and off,  i noticed they always come at night when I lay down to sleep and on those days I have been tired or working all day, what helps me fall asleep is counting different things in room repeatedly( sofa, wall, curtain, clock) if I repeatedly say these words it helps calm me down to sleep. 
Is there anything that I can do to prevent these palpitations because they worsen my anxiety.
Started magnesium supplements they seem to help but not much. 

Sometimes when my anxiety is worse, bp is always higher 150/90, so I started walking to control bp which helped 
I’ve had heart echo done 3 years ago it was normal
And ecg 4 years ago it showed arrhythmia but I think it was really nervous when they did it so they didn’t count it..
Again my heartbeat is always below 100 at resting
But high when palpitations hit which is sometimes

1716,I Used to Avoid Answering My Business Phone Due to Anxiety—Now I Don’t Have To,"

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had anxiety around answering phone calls. It doesn’t matter if it’s a client, a random number, or even someone I know—just seeing my phone ring would send my heart racing.

When I started my own business, I told myself I’d get over it. I figured I’d have to answer calls to be successful. But instead, I just started avoiding them. I let calls go to voicemail, took forever to call people back, and probably lost more opportunities than I even realized.

Eventually, it got to the point where I had to ask myself—do I actually want to run a business, or do I want to keep hiding from my own phone?  I knew I wasn’t going to magically wake up one day and love answering calls, so I started looking for a way to remove myself from the process entirely. That’s when I came across AI phone assistants. I set one up, trained it to handle the common questions people call about, and let it take over.

And honestly? It changed every time the phone rings. At first, I thought this was just a way to avoid my phone anxiety, but what I didn’t expect was how much better my business (and life) got because of it. Instead of stressing over calls, I could actually focus on my work. I started getting more done, feeling less drained, and ironically… my business started making more money. Not because I was grinding harder, but because I was no longer the bottleneck holding myself back.

For the first time, I felt like I had actual freedom. My income went up, my stress went down, and I was finally able to step away from my phone without feeling guilty.For years, I thought I had to just push through my anxiety, but the truth is—sometimes the best solution isn’t to force yourself to do something that makes you miserable. Sometimes, it’s about finding a smarter way to handle the problem.

I’m not saying AI is the answer for everyone, but for me, it was a game changer. Curious—does anyone else struggle with phone anxiety? How do you deal with it?",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iryb7v/i_used_to_avoid_answering_my_business_phone_due/,EnhancedNinja,1739834981.0,anxiety

Not particularly because of my ED as none of the thoughts in my head lead back to my body or weight at all; I just feel like my heart is racing and that my anxiety is a sign that something terrible is going to happen to me. I have a midterm and an essay due tomorrow that I am unprepared for. Being at school and campus makes me really really scared because I am always afraid that there will be a school shooting. I also am catching a ride from my friend back home from campus which I am also afraid might lead me into a freak accident with us dying. I am so scared, I can’t sleep. I really need to sleep because I have a super long day tomorrow with a lot of heavy work. I can’t shake off the fact that impending doom is a real medical symptom and a lot of people experience it before dying. My life has also been really good recently and I’ve been in such a positive and happy mood that I am so scared it means that something bad is going to happen to me as people say “bad things happen to good people.” I feel like running away, crying, and screaming.

The only issue? Constant sleepiness and drowsiness, making it hard to focus and stay productive. SSRIs weren’t an option for me due to nausea and weight loss, so this is the best combo so far.

I’m in so much pain when it happens, maybe for 2 to 4 hours before the pain goes away. And the next day I’m very sore and irritated. Yesterday it happened again, so today I was really scared to take it again, I asked the pharmacist if this was normal, he completely denied that it could be caused by the pill, saying it would have happened more than 4 times if it was an issue. Yes I do eat before and yes I do chug a full bottle of water with it.  (Except the first episode) Im only seeing my doctor in a month and Im scared to take it again.

1732,Selective Mutism Awareness,"**Selective Mutism Awareness** 💙

Selective Mutism (SM) is an anxiety disorder that affects a person's ability to speak in specific social settings, despite being able to talk comfortably in other environments. It is most commonly seen in children and is often misunderstood as extreme shyness or defiance.

**Why Awareness Matters:**

🔹 **Early Recognitio**n– Many children with SM go undiagnosed, delaying proper support.

🔹 **Understanding, Not Judgmen**t – SM is not a choice; it is a response to anxiety.

🔹 **Support and Treatmen**t – With the right interventions (e.g., gradual exposure, therapy, school accommodations), individuals with SM can gain confidence in speaking.

🔹 **Breaking the Stigm**a – Raising awareness fosters a more inclusive and compassionate society.

**How You Can Help:**

💙Learn about SM and share information.

💙Encourage teachers and caregivers to create supportive environments.

💙Advocate for accommodations in schools.

💙Be patient and respectful—never pressure someone with SM to speak.

I checked my internet - everything is working how it should be. Then I noticed that it's totally silent. There's nothing, no cars, no animals, total silence and this let me freak out even more. I'm dissociating. Nothing feels real. I tried to call some of my friends - nobody picked up, they don't even get my messages. I'm so scared right now. I'm even scared to just move. I don't know what I could do right now. ",7,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1irrw2f/everything_feels_not_real_right_now/,itsfinjab,1739819288.0,anxiety

1745,Feeling stuck and isolated – Need advice on navigating my struggles,"Hey, I’m David. I’m 17, and I’ve been in a bit of a rut lately. My life is complicated, and it’s hard to explain it all in one post, but I’ll try to keep it short.

To sum it up, I live with my mom’s younger sister (she’s 13 years younger than me) and my great-grandma in Southern California. My relationship with my dad has been very emotionally challenging, with a lot of trauma over the years. His temper, degrading comments, and the constant fear of setting him off have affected me deeply. There’s a lot more to it, but that’s the gist.

In the past 6 months, I’ve been dealing with some severe health issues—things like colitis and an impacted canine tooth. I’m a runner and have been working towards triathlons, marathons, and ultra runs. But the last few months have been a constant struggle to get back into my routines. Between dealing with family issues, health struggles, and having embarrassing situations on runs (like trying not to poop myself), I’m doing my best to keep pushing through. I’ve sold things like video games and other stuff to get gear for my training, and it’s been tough, but I’m determined to keep going.

But here’s the thing—I’ve become pretty isolated. I don’t go to parties, I don’t hang out with many people, and while I train sometimes with a friend, most of the time, it’s just me. Over the past year and a half, I’ve felt extremely lonely. I’m invested in my training and trying to push through all these demons that haunt me, but most of the time, I just feel like I’m alone in it.

Some days are better than others. When I’m running or biking, and my stomach doesn’t shut down, I feel great. But later in the day, it’s like a switch flips, and I feel severely depressed. It’s frustrating because I can’t pinpoint why. It’s not like I’m always sad, but I feel like no one understands what I’m going through. I wake up at 5:30 AM, train, and spend most of the day focusing on my routines. I don’t really socialize or hang out with friends, and it’s starting to wear on me. I don’t listen to music when I train, and some days, I break down in tears, which I don’t fully understand. Maybe it’s just a reflection of how much I’ve pushed through over the years.

I also have a history of anxiety, and right now, my OCD is pretty bad with strong compulsions and obsessions. I’ve switched to online school to focus more on my training, but I do still go to campus sometimes to hang out with a couple of friends.

I’m feeling stuck, lonely, and like I’m losing my balance. I just don’t know how to manage everything. I’m looking for advice, support, or if anyone else can relate to feeling like this, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.

1748,Convinced I have a brain tumor,"
Hi all - for starters yes, I have bad health anxiety so I’m hoping this is just stress related. I’ve been having full headaches for about a year now. They’re more annoying but I’ve kinda just learned to deal with them. If it’s bad I usually take a Tylenol and it’s better. Along with this I have really bad fatigue. I’m a mom of a two year old who has tons of energy and I also  WFH. He’s also not sleep trained and for the past 3-4 months he’s been sleeping with me everyday which means I’m not getting consistent sleep. I’ve also been increasingly getting depressed which has been affecting my energy levels as well. It’s so hard for me to focus at work, I’m constantly distracted by my phone and I have brain fog. I just feel like I’ve gotten dumb. 

For the past week though it’s been getting to me as to why I’m having these headaches and why I’m so tired all the time. So of course I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of googling and I’m now terrified that I have a brain tumor. My headaches for the past couple days have been constant which is unusual and then starting yesterday the right side of my face has gotten numb. The headaches are mainly on my right side but it’s constantly moving. My head feels It’s mostly in my forehead, behind my eyes, my temples. It’s like a pressured feeling. I’ve taken a Tylenol which usually helps but it’s not helping so I’m freaking out even more. I have an MRI scheduled for this Thursday but it’s worrying me so much I’m thinking of going to the ER tmrw morning. Has anyone else dealt with something similar?

1750,Starting sertraline but worried about long term mental dependency,"I just started taking sertraline for my anexity which has become increasingly worse over the last year or so. For reference, my anxiety has been minimal and manageable in the past without meds, but I started having panic attacks and constant anxiety. I feel this is also related to life experiences lately, so I've tried to focus on coping mechanisms as well as lifestyle changes.

I don't want to be on sertraline for the rest of my life. I'm curious of others experiences with it potentially working and eventually getting off it? We're you able to rebuild while on meds but then wean off and maintain a healthy mental state without medication? If not, did you decide to stay on a medication that worked for you?

And does anyone have any experiences with beta blockers? I've heard these are a good way to manage anxiety as needed and are less invasive? I preferred to try these first but was having issues communicating with my doctors office when they prescribed me sertraline and now I can't get in to see them for a month.

1776,Advice Needed (OCD),"For almost my entire life, I've had a compulsion that I call a ""reset."" There are aspects of my life, personality, and appearance that I am self conscious about and create a lot of stress. Essentially, a reset is a small ritual I do to start my life fresh. When I do that ritual and reset, I can ignore whatever happened prior to it and focus only on the present/future.

I've done this many thousands of times in my life. I started when I was five, and although the exact ritual has changed multiple times, the idea is exactly the same. The idea is for each reset to be the last one, but my OCD always finds a way to kill it and force me to do it again (could be a hair out of place, something I say that I later worry about, etc.) I believe my longest streak was no more than twenty days, and it's far more common for them to only last a few hours or even minutes.

When I quit a streak, I just decide a time to reset again, and the intervening period is basically just limbo time. I can be, do, say, or look whatever way, because I know I will reset later and be able to put it behind me. I am not motivated to get work done, or do anything else productive during these limbo periods. I only feel good and motivated during a streak after a successful reset.

Now we get to my current problem.

Last week when I was waiting to reset later in the day, I had skipped class and decided to watch Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise as the main character. The movie basically has a confusing plot that ends in the revelation that Cruise is dead and has been living in a lucid dream the whole time.

I noticed somewhere in the middle of the movie that I felt drawn to the story and connected it in some vague way to my own life. Part of it was when he constantly wore a latex mask to cover his face after a bad accident. It seemed similar to my own insecurities about my appearance. At a certain point I began pulling up photos of myself as a child while watching the movie (I couldn't exactly tell you why, but it has something to do with my desire to start my life over and be born all over again with better luck.)

I started to think about the reset I had planned for later that day and began to think about how this movie experience and my relating it to my own life would make the reset more profound and possibly successful (in staying permanent.)

That's when the plot twist dropped and it revealed that Tom Cruise's life was all fake and constructed by a corporation as a lucid dream. I immediately felt a sense of dread. When I was maybe 12, I agonized for months over the idea of solipsism (that the universe is all in my head, none of the people around me are real.) And although I didn't begin worrying about that right away, I started to get anxious about something in particular.

If I reset any time soon, and it happens to actually be successful in staying permanent, it will be too close in proximity to watching this movie. I have reset thousands of times and it has never worked out long-term, so now I'm afraid that if I reset in the coming weeks or months and it actually does work out, it will be because my life isn't real just like Tom Cruise's in the movie. A successful, permanent streak after so many years of trying would be too conspicuous right after having this experience with Vanilla Sky. I badly want to reset because it's the only thing that comforts and motivates me, but I can't do it for this reason. I'm terrified that my life might not be real and it's all an illusion, which is why I can't reset now.

1779,Switching from Zoloft to Buspirone,"First time posting something like this but looking for some thoughts from people that actually “get it” with anxiety because my PCP has never been any help and I’ve tried many SSRI’s, Xanax, and now buspirone. I’ve been on and off Zoloft for 10 years now and usually end up back on it because the withdrawal is too much to bare as well as it is the only thing that’s prevented panic attacks somehow. However, Zoloft has become in effective and the side effects have become much worse than any benefit it provided. Fast forward to about 6 weeks ago, my doctor had me taper (very fast) off Zoloft and start buspirone. I’m taking 10mg of Buspirone twice daily and have now been completely off Zoloft for 2 weeks. The last two weeks were hell whether it was brain zaps, headaches, nausea, etc. I finally feel like I’m over the hump from some of the heavy withdrawal symptoms from Zoloft but still find myself with occasional brain zaps and nausea in the afternoon. Trying to understand if this would still be withdrawal related or side effects of buspirone. Finally, my anxiety is primarily health anxiety (spending way too much time overthinking every ache and pain etc) and fear of another panic attack coming. Unfortunately this hasn’t gone away and is still quite bad this week. Curious if anyone else deals with this type of thing and has tried a medicine switch like this. I’m going to try to be patient a little longer but sick of feeling like this. I’ve seen people on here say that buspirone helped their anxiety nearly immediately and I’m 6 weeks in with little to no help, but hoping it’s exacerbated by coming off Zoloft?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1is0mmf/switching_from_zoloft_to_buspirone/,JG4King,1739841491.0,anxiety

I've got the typical stress/anxiety that I think most have with bills, health and what not. But starting Thanksgiving day I had several things happen like problems with my dog, health scares with my son and I, money/bills. My anxiety/stress levels have been elevated to a level I haven't experienced. No depression (like self harm or dark thoughts type), no panic attacks. I'm honestly just mentally exhausted from everything. I know stress can sometimes cause bowel irregularities. But other than that and the dull ache in my gut area, that's all I've been dealing with. Can extreme stress cause inflamed gut problems? I've talked to my primary doc and he recommended that I get a CT scan done to see if there's anything going on...which makes anxiety worse lol. Honestly I'm just a worry wart when it comes to a bunch of stuff and I don't know who to go to or talk to because some times I feel like the medical people just want to medicate rather than getting to the root issue.

I have Autism and ADHD, which doesn’t help either emotion-wise. I haven’t gone in around 5 months and the last time I went I couldn’t afford their fillings at the time, so I didn’t go to my cleaning and found another office. I feel significant shame, as I hate seeing the visible cavities I have… I brush and floss, I even have prescription toothpaste. I haven’t drank any sweetened drinks and tried to stay away from sweets and maintain a good hygiene routine,.. but I did pick up the habit of energy drinks and “sugar added” snacks 🥲 How I wish I could turn back time! I also am overly anxious about the cost of everything. I felt like when I was using my mirror I saw a cavity everywhere… and as a broke college student seeing that it looks like I have 9 cavities is not thrilling. 
Has anyone else dealt with this? Am I screwed? I just want these cavities gone and to implement a very rigid routine to maintain decent dental health. I want to crawl in a hole and have someone inhabit my body so I don’t have to physically be present at the dentist; my thoughts are turning obsessive thinking about my teeth and gum health, and yet looking at the state of my mouth it feels too late even though it’s not.

Three weeks ago, both my short-term and long-term memory began to fail me. I talked with my therapist and psychiatrist about it, and they explained that it’s a normal side effect of GAD and depression—that it will eventually self-regulate.

I couldn’t handle the fear anymore, so I bit the bullet and went to see a neurologist. After an evaluation, he agreed with my therapist’s opinion: nothing is wrong with me; everything is just a result of my emotional state.

My job is slowly killing me, and I feel powerless to do anything. But I still need to work and parent and pay for my family’s livelihood, so I just have to keep going. But that’s neither here nor there. My most pressing issue is that I’m off my meds. Six months ago I switched to Wellbutrin after a two year postpartum stint on Zoloft. I thought I needed the boost in focus Wellbutrin would provide, since I’d been on it in the past successfully. But I’m terrible at taking meds, and it just never really took this time. I’m sure the frequency at which I took it didn’t help, but I didn’t see the boost with attention/focus and my anxiety progressively got worse. My life surely has changed since the last time I was on it so I kept thinking it would just take time. My prescription was running low so I messaged my doctor (general physician) to request switching back to Zoloft about ten days ago. Her office gave me the runaround for a week saying she would get back to me. Then my Wellbutrin ran out, no refills. Then doctor’s office staff said, sorry she’s now on vacation, so call and make an appointment. So two I’m almost two weeks without meds and situationally things are getting worse. I have contacted a new practice that is specific for mental health and neurobehavioral medication management. I’m going to call my current physician in the morning and see if they can get me in to see anyone sooner. Just someone please tell me that the medication will help.

1796,Parents - how do you not worry like I do,"I have two kids 15 and 11 and I have health anxiety around my oldest that has become so invasive that it has negatively affected every aspect of my daily life. For years now, every ache or pain or symptom she has, I immediately attribute to cancer. I picture the whole process from diagnosis to treatment to suffering to funeral and my shattered future without her. Right now, she has an aggrivated lymph node to the rear of her neck. It's firm so I have spent the last day coming to terms with it being the first symptom of lymphoma. I'm a shell of who I used to be.

It never stops. I think of it all day, and when I do sleep, I dream about it. I feel like it's a premonition or a mother's intuition I should not ignore. I feel it's inevitable, and her only slim hope is me catching it. I feel like my alarm bells are screaming and no one else hears it. 

My husband is over it and says I've already subjected her to too many medical tests. He says it has infiltrated every conversation, and our marriage is worse for it. I get it - but her health is serious and I don't understand how he can be so blase about it. I told him about the lymph node and he said ""it's nothing"" and went about the day. Didn't even have the need to feel it. Just said that's fine, normal even - she's healthy and that's all there is to it. Meanwhile I have to urge to take her to the ER for imaging and to catch it early. Headaches are brain tumors, sore legs are bone cancer, stomach aches and pale skin is leukemia. In my head, she's doomed. Because I missed it. 

I've tried medications over the years with no results. I've tried talk therapy. No improvement. I worry about my younger child and can go on health anxiety kicks with her as well, but certainly not to this exent. 

I need advice - how do you do it? How do you sit with the uncertainty? I'm responsible for her health and survival. It sounds nuts. I know I can't control everything. But I can't shake the feeling and it is ruining my life.

1803,Anxious about appendicitis,"I have an anxiety about appendicitis l. I also have a history of IBS/gas pains, which specifically manifests on my right side. 

Right now I have stomach pain on my right side, which doesn’t really hurt unless I laugh or press on it. But it does feel kind of heavy. I also have been very gassy, my stomach has been grumbling, and I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot. 

I’m just concerned because the stomach pain is on my lower right side. And it feels tender on many places in that area, including the place where my appendix would be. And it’s so scary. 

I’ve had this happen in the past, and it’s always gone away on its own within a few days. Which is why I’m hesitant to go to urgent care. 

Anyone else have a fear of appendicitis, and what can be done about it?

I’m not someone who gets heartburn but the only way I can describe the feeling is that it’s probably like awful heartburn. As if someone has lit a match in my stomach or the bottom of my esophagus. And this feeling can stick with me on-and-off for up to 1-2 days, even after the initial panic has passed. It keeps me from sleeping, standing up for long periods of time, and makes it difficult to focus on other things like work.

The thought of preparing chicken and eating it makes me want to gag. I can tolerate chicken from some restaurants or fast food places, but for the most part I find it repulsive. I used to always find chicken a bit icky, but it was never to the point where I couldn’t eat it. I kind of feel repulsed by most meat now, except for steak and bacon. I’m not sure if this is part of my anxiety due to the fact that I’ve always been a bit nervous around meat due to my emetophobia. I’m not sure if I should just mainly cut meat out of my diet or if that’s me giving into my anxiety and fears. 

I’m also not sure if this is just a meat issue because I haven’t been able to get myself to expand back to what I used to eat, especially when it comes to vegetables and fruits. I’m slowly trying to add more foods into my diet and eat things I used to, but it’s scary and challenging. I don’t know if I should cut out meat all together or what to do right now.

It’s making me panic and want to abort mission but I feel trapped because I wanted to get off for feeling so numb / dissociated / low energy / no motivation. Feels like either way I can’t be okay. 

Idk what to do anymore 😞 my psychiatrist basically fired me for taking too long to get off my my med bc she thinks I’m torturing myself and wants me to quick get off and put me on something else.

I'm 20 now and obviously still have anxiety and OCD, I'm just not medicated, although there are a LOT of points where I really feel that I should be. I'm currently studying for the LSAT (to get into law school) and I really need a good score. The problem is, just the thought of taking the test sends me into fight or flight. I think it's a compulsive thing because I know I need a good score to get into a good law school, so my body makes me feel like I'm about to get mauled by bears because it's an important life milestone. I know I'm smart enough to get a good score, but the anxiety is eating me alive over it. Has anyone experienced a decrease in anxiety over something like this after getting on medication? I've been taking Benadryl for the overwhelming dread that I sometimes feel from this test, just to calm me down before bed or something, but I feel like I could maybe benefit from getting back on medication.

1816,How do I get through this?,"Hi, I'm a 23 year old female and I was diagnosed with anxiety in my early teens.

I did pretty well with it and ended up no longer needing therapy. Years after, I went through a bout of horrible illness and constant surgery. From the age of 18 until now, I've been seriously struggling with my illness and it left me unable to leave the house.

I started to improve, I was definitely well enough to go out more but the sheer anxiety and fear of getting sick in public and just the general overwhelm of the outside world after barely experiencing it for so many years cripples me. 

I'm starting work again next week. I work with children and my job is super local to me, so this isn't a worry. But I can't go 5 mins away from home without having horrific panic attacks. I want to do more than just work, I haven't seen friends or been ANYWHERE in years now.

I am on the wait list for therapy, But I have been since June of last year. I don't have the money to pay for therapy, so I just need to hold out on the NHS' very long wait list.

I'm wondering what I can do in the meantime to push myself a little more? I get so close to pushing myself to do something but then just become debilitated by the panic.

Anyway, the other day, I recognized the music that my teacher was listening to in class, and I actually had the courage to say something to him. (Normally, I would've stayed silent.)

All I said to him was, “Are you listening to *Band Name*? Oh cool, I like this song.” 

*Two sentences*. Thats literally all I fucking said... I got too nervous to say anything else, and I quickly went back to my seat before he could even respond back, lmfao.

1820,I learned why getting excited turns into anxiety!,"So, I have ADHD and GAD. I try to avoid getting overly excited because I feel like I have no control... due to all the energy. Upon research (Google lol), Both anxiety and excitement share the SAME physical responses. Such as that fight/flight response, or the adrenaline and higher heartbeat. Now due to my past childhood experiences, I associate excitement with a negative outcome.

  
For example, If I hear good news about a girl liking me, I will get super excited. But then a WAVE of negative thoughts will come because the anxiety takes over. and humbles the duck out of me lol. But I now recognize this at the age of 23. I need to reframe my thoughts more and be more mindful of what excitement feels like. 

  
Also, getting excited around people makes me anxious because I don't want to appear too hyper, or ""out of character"". Because I am mainly seen as calm. That is because I reserve and hold back a HUMUNGOUS amount of energy 24/7. Some of you will call that masking. A coworker actually told me that the energy deserves to be released.

1829,Im 17 and i dont know how to keep going,"
Hi, im 17F and english isnt my first language so sorry in advance for any mistakes. 
I think I genuinely destroyed the little life I had left

I've had depression for half my life and suicidal thoughts since forever, but last year in particular was worse than ever. To give a little context, I always had mental issues and I grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional family where almost everyone around me had BPD.

at the beginning of 2024 I lost all my friends because I changed schools and started working, some still checked on me from time to time but I lost all the affection I had for them after realizing the lack of interest they had for me, I also had acne for the first time in my life (I am extremely obsessive about my appearance) which led me to have extreme anxiety when interacting with other people and being in public, so I ended up socially isolating myself. 
Results: i stopped going to school and lost the year, and if I wanted to graduate I would have to do the entire school year from scratch and I would only get my diploma at 19 and a half years old. So I dropped out of school, the school year started approximately 2 months ago and I'm not enrolled and probably won't be. My parents don't care much about my education, they are pretty old already and stopped giving me direction in life a long time ago They didn't say anything when I lost the year or when I dropped out of school, they didn't say anything at all, but i guess they just lost the little hope they had for me.

I have no desire to go to college, or any interest in any course or profession, and to be honest I've always been like that, my parents never really made me think about my future, They kind of always just let me loose

The only thing I ever genuinely thought about being was a flight attendant, I'm conventionally attractive, people always said I have an elegant appearance, I would like to travel and live an eventful life, I'm great with languages ​​and until then I was pretty good at communicating

I don't know how I would graduate high school, the days go pass and I become more certain that I wouldn't be able to return and graduate late for a million reasons, there is the option of taking tests and graduating another way ig, but I have dyscalculia which makes everything 100 times more difficult.

After the disappointments I had with friendships last year I no longer have anyone by my side, and I don't really think Im able anymore to build new relationships. I don't have anyone that I love in my life.

The only escape for me would be to move to another city (I live in a very small city) but that would be impossible without the help of my family, and i dont think they want to help anymore 

So I think I'm just going to spend a few years lying in bed, watching life go by, just like my sister did

most of the time when this happens there is a trigger that causes the depressive episode, we know that much (im freely using the word depression because i have been diagnosed, with major dp and anxiety/panic disorder, my psychiatrist also talked about BPD but hasn't made the official diagnosis yet due to me not being an adult yet then (i turned 18 this month) ,none of the many mh professionals ive seen ever suspected Bipolar disorder in me ( I can switch from the most energetic and happy person to a lifeless depressed one in a day)

 Aside from the depressive episodes , there are periods where im insanely positive about everything,(usually for no reason, i cant find an explanation, a cause for this mood n behavior) very energetic, and happy for existing, getting ideas left and right (though after a day of this i feel physically tired , never mentally) this can go on for 1.5 to 3 days MAXIMUM never more. After that follows a period where im my ""normal"" self not happy not intensely depressed,

 im usually in this normal state for some weeks maybe at least 4 (i started recently tracking my mood, because whenever the doctors would ask me about mood changes i couldn't remember anything) usually or if a trigger shows up i get in that extreme depressive episode.

1832,I can't stand routine,"DISCLAIMER I'm not asking to be assigned a diagnosis i don't really care about collecting those and I'm aware this isn't the place to do so. I just need to get this out of my head and debating helps. Also my therapy sessions are short so I'd like to have my thoughts n theories straight. To me OCD, BPD, ADHD etc are just medical terms to designate groups with common traits and not things I live by, I don't use them for self diagnosis here just their designated traits and effeciency in explaining.


Hey, so the subject of OCD has been mentioned with my therapist but not in depth..
I do have ADHD diagnosed, so I've attributed a lot of these behaviors to that. However last night I've had a moment of realization and need to ask if this is something that maybe resonnates with OCD tomfoolery or something else idk feel free to give your thoughts.

I've realized I always need to end habitual behaviors and routines because they become insufferable. I realized this as I couldn't find sleep because I took up the habit of adjusting my sleeping position to lessen my back pain, except lately everything feels ""not quite right"". I fixated on every muscle, the shape of the pillow, how my shoulder slopes forward, everything. I perfect it until there is no longer a sufficient result... And last night it kept me up until 5am until I purposefully chose a terrible position and forced myself to let go.

This happens with everything. There is a bus 5 minutes away I actively choose to not use because I went up that tiny hill every day for too long and I sometimes choose a longer route to another bus just to avoid that hill because it seems endless to me now. To be clear, it is a 15 step hill max, nothing to be reluctant at. I just hate it.

Same with workouts, after a few weeks the thought of it would give me panic attacks.

1833,Is there a risk I go completely crazy ?,"Lately I've been thinking that MAYBE nothing is real and we live in a simulation or I've been asleep in a nightmare for a long time and the only way to get out is to die. HOWEVER I think of myself as a very rational person and I don't think I would actually do that unless I had solid proof, certainty, that it was real. And so far there has been no evidence for this theory and I'm scared of dying anyway. But despite the lack of proof, for some reason, it's taking more and more space in my mind, probably because things haven't been going really well lately. My question is : will this go away on it's own or is there a risk I lose touch with reality and actually do the thing, in which case I would have to see a professional before it gets to this point ?

1834,My friend trying to kill himself made me realize how bad I was,"Honestly I feel like I'm being dragged into the ocean.
To put in some context my friend and I had a discussion about mental health due to him trying to ""off himself"" and after he was done talking, and after I was done listening, ""he said, do you have anything to share?""
So not to make him feel left out and I also thought he shared something that he didn't need to share but he did and it was good for him so, how about I do the same. 
After I've verbalized what experiences I've been dealing with I realized how deep I am into this creaky staircase.
What's I basically said with a bit more information is that I've been dealing with parasomnia virtually two years. But in the past few weeks, the hallucinations and experiences have been increasing in the best way I can say it is they've gotten more violent not in a way of people trying to kill me in my hallucination, but more vivid more real more fear inducing more ""violent"" along with these hallucinations happening while I'm awake (parasomnia is a sleep disorder)
And what I said, last really shook me to the core of my fucked up head, ""I don't know anymore man, like, I'm supposed to know these things. I'm supposed to know when it's wrong when it's hurt but everything is hurting and I can't find, the cut""
And I think what I said are so scared my friend I think he's also realized the severity of what's been happening with me and I've also realized the severity of what's happening with him, but I feel so disappointed not in him, but I just feel disappointed in general I don't know why, but I know that he's not able to help me. He's not able to guide me through what I've been experiencing. I'm able to, but he's not and I'm feeling the backlash of that and I don't know why.
But finally, when I had some alone time completely by myself, I finally dug deeper into my symptoms into what I've been feeling what i've been experiencing ""experiencing""
And I have a very large knowledge about mental illnesses, neurological disorders, just psychology in general.
I have not felt so dearly to my heart in this statement and that's a big thing. I truly believe I have **Schizoaffective Disorder**
Now, if you don't know what that is, I truly don't want to explain it after reading through what the hell I've been experiencing and understanding what is happening as I was reading and matching everything up doing the math what little smile I had on my face was completely gone. I just felt true and utter despair. Not a lot of people understand what it feels like for your heart to sink into and your chest, but I now know what it feels like. And I'm in a complete loss. I don't know what to do. I'm supposed to know what to do whenever. One of my friends are sad. I'm supposed to know how to fix it, but I can't even fix myself and realizing how bad it is makes everything so worse I know I'm going down something. I can't go back from something that I need to rip bones out of my body to build a climbing wall back up.
I'm just so lost. I wouldn't even want to say loss. I'm just ""missing."" I no longer feel like I have control over what I think or what I see. I'm just going through the hell of it. Head first with already a concussion. I just need words. I just need something to make me feel a bit better of what's happening. I don't know what will make me feel better just **words**.",5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ivb7f4/my_friend_trying_to_kill_himself_made_me_realize/,DrunkTrainDriver,1740200884.0,mentalillness
1835,My experience in a mental hospital,"I wanted to make a post sharing my experience in a mental hospital. I figured other people, like me, would be curious about what happens, the process of going to one, the discharging process, etc.

I want to start by saying that no two peoples experience inside a mental hospital will be the same. My experience inside one might be drastically different than another person's experience. What happened to me during the process might not happen to you, and vice versa. Take this with a small grain of salt. 

I also want to make it clear that I absolutely do not regret going to one, and if you're stuck on the fence about getting help, please get it, that's what they're there for.

There's many different ways and reasons someone might end up in a mental hospital. I was a voluntary admit. I won't talk about why I felt like I needed to go, because it's not revenant to this. But I won't lie and say that saying you need help is easy. Getting help was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It took me 3 days of mustering up courage to ask my parents to take me to the ER. 

This might not be relevant, but I wanted to include it anyway. If your parents sit you down when you ask them for help (as in if you ask to go to the ER like I did), and try to come up with solutions, say no. Seriously, tell them no, you don't want to talk, tell them you just want to go. If you're at the point if needing to go to the ER for your mental health, sitting down and talking about it is not enough. If your parents won't take you, go anyway. Walk there if you have to. If they get mad at you for it, that's not your problem. I only asked my parents because I didn't want to leave my car at the hospital for a long time. Just go. 


Anyway, went I got to the ER, they began the admit process. They'll take your stuff away, your phone, keys, wallet, clothes, shoes, and put you in a bed with only your underwear and a gown on. They'll hold your things until they determine what to do next. You might get an IV, blood drawn, asked for a urine sample, the works. 

You'll talk with a crisis worker. Depending on what time you go in it might be through a computer or a TV with a camera. They'll ask you some basic questions like:

- Do you have thoughts of suicide or self harm?
- How long have you had these thoughts / what triggers them?
- etc.

Pretty basic stuff, just answer the best you can.

Depending on what their assessment is, they'll recommend you a couple options, like going home with a safety plan, hospitalization, etc.

I chose the hospital, obviously. After that they'll find you a bed at a mental hospital somewhere. This could take an hour, or you stay at the ER overnight, it really just depends.

After they found me a bed, they shipped me off in an ambulance. You'll have to get on a stretcher and have them push you around. It's a little awkward, but it's kinda fun in a way. You might be able to get approved to have your parents take you, but there's a good chance it won't happen, especially if you're in a severe state. Don't let it discourage you.

After the ambulance ride they admit you to the hospital, you'll probably wait in a room until a nurse can come in and ask you another 3 dozen questions. There's a LOT of questions during this process, but most of them are during the admission and discharge process. They'll likely have you undress to your underwear to check you for cuts and scars. They'll have whichever gender nurse/tech do it that you prefer. Then they'll probably give you some scrubs to put on. Once you're all done, you'll probably be exhausted, and they'll take you to your bed so you can get some sleep. If it's like the hospital I went to, you'll have a roommate of the same gender as you. If you're non-binary, I'm not sure, you might get a room alone. There were people who were non-binary in our ward and that's what happened with them. You're not allowed to close your door, and someone will probably be checking on you constantly throughout the night. 

The first day is always the hardest. Main thing will be boredom and regret. Unless you brought a (soft cover) book, cards, or something else they allow, there's not much to do. There'll probably be a TV in a main area you can watch. Maybe some crosswords and drawing with markers or bendy pens. I was pretty numb at this point, so I wasn't thinking about depression, I was just thinking about how much of a mistake I thought I made and how much I wanted to leave. At this point it's just about getting better. In mental hospitals, you don't have to do anything. They won't force you to go to therapy groups, breakfast, lunch, etc. But your participation in them affects if you're discharged sooner or later. If you smoke, they have smoke breaks with provided cigarettes. They will only let those of age smoke though, so if you're a 14 year old cigarette addict, don't know what to tell ya. They might have nicotine gum too. No alcohol obviously. They'll have showers and hygenie supplies like deodorant, shampoo and conditioner. You get the gist. They let you make phone calls during designated times, but if you need to make one at a different time, I'd have a hard time imagining them refusing. If you have any problems, there should be a patient advocate at the hospital they're required to let you talk to if you request it. 

You're not allowed to get to know the other patients, as in you're not allowed to contact them after you leave, for many reasons. Which kinda sucks, because mostly everyone there was someone I wanted to be friends with. People will be there for many reasons, some of them might be ex convicts, drug abusers, psychotic patients, but in my experience, everyone was super nice... at least patients were nice to each other, some of them argued with the therapists. Everyone was separated into different wards for their needs/safety. For example the kids weren't put with us adults, the psychotic patients were seperate for their own needs, etc. 

A misconception I had was this was going to be therapy all day every day. But it was more so of stabilization. A psychiatrist might change your meds if you're on them, or prescribe some if you're not. I had my meds shifted around and it's like my world was flipped upside down. I can't put into words how good of a change it was. 

I'm leaving quite a bit out since it's either not relevant, no useful to you, or personal, but to be honest, not a ton happens in mental hospitals all day. It's really a break from reality and to make sure you're okay enough to keep going. They won't kick you out if they think your problems aren't serious, or at any point tell you 'tough shit' and show you the door. Keep in mind that you'll only get as much out of inpatient as you put into it. I was there a week, and I went to group everyday, took my meds, was honest about my feelings, etc. 

It's important to know that you'll probably regret going the first one, two, or more days. But don't tell the therapists and psychiatrists what they want to hear to get out sooner. This is a rare opportunity to put reality on halt. And at the end of it? I honestly didn't want to leave that much. I was really enjoying it. 

I might have missed stuff, so if you have questions, feel free to ask.",11,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iv4s2y/my_experience_in_a_mental_hospital/,AnUnfortunateLife_,1740179860.0,mentalillness
1836,Question for other people with mental health issues,"Small mention of self harm

What the fuck is wrong with me/have other people experienced this

So I have a bit of a problem. I don’t know how to deal with my emotions. Specifically anger and frustration. I get unreasonably upset at small things, like being told no to certain things, minor inconveniences, and other things along those lines. 

Whenever this happens, I get upset. I normally get angry and want to punch a wall or something, but I don’t because I’m scared of being angry. So I end up going somewhere quiet/secluded and scratching at myself/my skin and crying out of anger or frustration. This normally only lasts for about 10 minutes-30 minutes. Sometimes a little longer sometimes a little less. I don’t think I do it for attention, because I hate having people’s attention on me. Which is why I go somewhere private to have my emotions.

I don’t like people seeing me angry. I have this horrible fear of ‘ruining my image’ despite not really knowing what that means myself? I feel ashamed when people see me angry, as everyone always sees me as kind. I also hate conflict, which is why it’s hard to get mad at people and show it.

Afterwards I get embarrassed for it, and make jokes about myself overreacting so heavily. It’s embarrassing how over minor inconveniences and small things I immediately go to wanting to kill myself. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, and I have memory problems so I constantly forget to bring it up during my therapy sessions. 

I’m writing this both to get my thoughts down and to make sure I remember to tell her next session. **I’m not asking anyone to diagnose me.** I just want ideas and people to possibly share similar experiences. I feel like somethings wrong with me. My therapist would probably dislike me using that language, but I really feel like I’m inherently broken in some way.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ivejmi/question_for_other_people_with_mental_health/,TheC0re_,1740214292.0,mentalillness

1839,Starting to become hopeless and my thoughts are getting bad again,"I am starting to feel hopeless again in life and now my thoughts won't leave I constantly see myself in my mind stabbing and slashing myself and I took a bath and I was so tempted to take a breath underwater. I feel this shadow lurking behind me whispering into my soul to hurt myself and I just can't shake it. 

I constantly thinking about killing myself and I get this sudden impulse to do it. I am able to talk myself out so far with the thought of it not being enough. I feel like I'm so close to just snapping and doing it inpulsuvly. I was outside and remembered a knife was stabbed into the tree and I walked over there ready to grab it and stab it into my chest but it was gone, I can't imagine if it was actually there. When I get impulsive it's like I have no second thought. I'm not scared of doing it I WANT to do it but I'm scared of doing it and failing and having to restart everything I have earned. That's the only thing keeping me here. 

Honestly I have tried to use all the coping skills yet nothing has changed. The only thing is that I'm no longer actively doing anything anymore and that's not because of treatment but because of the fear of failing. I'm on 6 different medications and yet I still feel like I'm stuck in a fog. 
Self harm isn't like how it used to be it feels like something is stopping me physically and it absolutely frightening that I can't do it like how I want to. It's like a nightmare that I'm trapped in and my body isn't my own. It's odd because I have the option to do it yet I feel like I can't. However having the option this whole time has kept me from becoming too desperate.

1843,Evaluation,"Evaluation

Hey, I just had an evaluation for partial hospitalization today, and I wanted to share what happened because I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. The whole experience left me confused and a little upset, especially with some of the things my mom said during the process. Here’s how it went:

So, the therapist and I were going through the usual questions, talking about my past, mood swings, and all that stuff. Then, during the depression test, the therapist asked about “defiance,” and my mom immediately said yes. That caught me off guard, and I didn’t expect it. She explained that I was defiant because of the whole situation with the ambulance. 
Because I was about to act on my suicidal thoughts so that’s why I called them, but she was upset that I didn’t go to her first


I called 911 instead of going to her first, which was part of my safety plan. According to my mom, that was considered defiant behavior.

This really threw me off because I don’t understand why she’s focusing so much on that. If I had gone to her, what would she have done anyway? I felt like my safety plan was kind of useless because, in that moment, I felt like my best option was calling 911. The whole situation just felt really confusing.

Then, my mom started talking about social media being bad for me because I sometimes look up things that lead to self-diagnosis. I don’t look at videos to self-diagnose at all, but I do watch videos or read stuff to feel supported or relate to others. She said it’s the same as self-diagnosing, and that made me feel embarrassed. I tried to explain that I don’t do it that way, and I was just trying to connect with people, but she insisted that it’s harmful. That really bothered me, and I felt like I had to defend myself even though I don’t really do that.

We talked about my mood swings too. I said that sometimes I can feel really up, but it’s not necessarily related to my medication. I told her about an episode over the summer where I stayed up for two days straight, and my mom dismissed it as “normal teenage stuff.” She compared it to her own experiences when she was my age and said that it’s just part of growing up. But, I really didn’t feel like it was normal, especially when my friend said they’ve never stayed up for multiple days because of feeling happy.

Then the therapist said something about how it’s teenage issues, but she wasn’t talking about the staying up.

My mom agreed and said exactly that—it’s just me being a teenager. But I tried to explain that comparing myself isn’t in a negative way; I’m just trying to understand if what I’m going through is normal or not.

I go through extreme highs, like having so much energy and motivation, and then I drop down to very low lows. I don’t think that’s regular teenage behavior, and that’s what I was trying to explain to them.

During the evaluation, the therapist said that my OCD could be the reason for my extreme suicidal thoughts. I told her that I really want to act on them, that if I could do it right then, I would. I was once told that suicidal thoughts could be a part of puberty, and I get that, but I actually want to act on them. I’ve been having them since I was about 11 years old.

She also mentioned that I might be blaming others when I think of myself as a burden. That part really stuck with me because I don’t think that’s what’s happening. I’ve been trying to get better, but I don’t think it’s as simple as blaming others. I just feel like a burden, and I don’t blame anyone for it. It’s just hard when my little sister has to help me get around, and I’m 16 years old. She said I believe things that aren’t true and that I’m hard on myself, which I agree with.

Then the therapist asked, “What do you want to get treatment for?” I said I want to learn how to control my thoughts because that’s what everyone is saying I need to do. She asked my mom the same question, and she said she wants me to learn how to manage myself better, like understanding that just because I had a bad day doesn’t mean I should act on suicidal thoughts. But it’s not because I had a bad day—it’s just that the thoughts are so intense. Like I wake up and I think about it all day and if I could do it I would like right now 

After all of that, as we were walking out, I told my mom how I felt about the self-diagnosis thing. She suggested we ask the therapist again, so we did. We walked back, and my mom rang the doorbell. I asked the therapist, “Do you view me differently when my mom says that I self-diagnose?” She said I contradict myself a lot but didn’t think any differently of me. I told her I felt like I was being misunderstood, like when my mom said it’s just teenage stuff or that I self-diagnose. It felt like it could raise a red flag and make people not take me seriously. The therapist reassured me that she didn’t think that way.

The biggest thing that’s bothering me, though, is the “defiant” part. My mom thinks I’m being defiant because I don’t follow through with the plans she thinks I should, especially when it comes to religion and my mental health. She says I’m stuck because I don’t choose God, and that I’m “overthinking everything” instead of trusting the process.

I guess what I’m really stuck on is that when I do things like calling 911, I don’t think it’s defiant. It’s just that in those moments, I’m trying to stay safe. But it seems like every time I make a decision like that, my mom or others look at it as me being defiant or rebellious, and it just feels frustrating.

Also, I mentioned that I watch Dr. Phil as a coping mechanism, and the therapist  and my mom both of them at the same time 
said that was a problem too, because it’s tied to my mental health. I tried explaining that I just need stimulation because I get bored easily and my brain needs constant engagement. She said I could find other ways to stimulate my brain, like reading a book. That felt like another way of invalidating what helps me in those moments, even though I just need something to keep me distracted. It was my mom really saying that the therapist was agreeing 

I’m really trying my best, but it’s like I’m stuck in this loop of second-guessing everything. I just don’t want to feel like I’m misunderstood.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or felt like their mental health was dismissed or misunderstood by family during an evaluation? Any advice on how to navigate these feelings?
I would go to my friends but they are my age and my
Mom said I have my friends now but they are going to want some reciprocity and they don’t want to have to walk on eggshells around me because they don’t know what might trigger me to think about suicide or to trigger my anxiety she calls it so-called anxiety though

Even though we are still in high school I think (thought kinda idk) that she could be the one because I had had a failed relationship in the passed and I thought I fixed many of my mistakes. We are waiting until marriage, very communicative, very respectful to each other, and caring. Everything is going fine right? Until its not. So I get word that a boy in her class was trying to be funny and asked her to keep talking because he was almost finished. She humored him and when I confronted her she said she didn't know what it meant. Now I know this would make anyone mad but that's not even it. We got into an argument and I realized that I'm too obsessed over her.

I start dating a girl, I get really obsessed with her, I need her too much which puts stress on her, when she can't be there for me all the time I start to break down, we argue, we make up, and then the loop starts. I'm genuinely a good person this makes me so sad that because I have mental issues that I'm like this. This isn't me. I need help and I don't know if meds will help or what. You could tell me just to not expect so much from her which would be the case if my mind wasn't so fucked. I don't want to feel this way. I want to be normal. I need to be normal.

1852,Boyfriend and self harm scars,"Could someone please help me? I’m lost. I’m worried. Is it bad that I love and care for my partner so much and want to be with him? …

I’ve thought about breaking up with him in the past due to past relationship trauma and insecurities…

Whenever I tried breaking up with him, he wouldn’t let me?? He would say that he will fight for our relationship and that he loves me more than anything. That we are better together than apart. 

He’s literally my bestest friend and I love being around him. He’s always supportive and there for me. I’m able to unmask around him than anyone else. 

When I tried talking to him again about breaking up and moving out, he said he didn’t want to talk about it and showed me his self harm scars. 

Idk if that’s a red flag? He’s sensitive and gets panic attacks. 

I love him so fucking much. I don’t want to lose him. 

I wanted to break up because I wanted to focus on myself and didn’t want to be in a relationship but I’m so torn…I don’t want to lose him. I love him. He said that he wants to do couples counseling. 

I can’t imagine my life without him. I love love loveee being around him. He makes me feel safe and secure. We’re always there for each other. He’s never ever harmed me. He’s so soft and sensitive. Whenever I’m in a bad mood (depressed), he comforts me and tries to help make me feel better.

1858,"In August 2024, I believe I had serotonin syndrome and am having lasting effects from it.","Hello. 31F. In August 2024, I got a new doctor, as my previous one left and I had not been taking my Zoloft like I should for several months(as my mother had passed and I had little ambition to do anything really). New Doctor prescribes all my meds again and I took them (I figured I took them befor, I would be fine). I slept maybe a few hours nd woke up and felt off. I tried to get back to sleep but I couldn't. I work nights as a healthcare worker. I go to work and felt okay but anxious and off. I chalked it up to I was tired. In the middle of the night, I get hit with a heat wave (best way I could describe it) and felt like I was going to pass out. My body got weak and I had to sit down. I felt confused and just not right at all. I called a family member and woke them up and stated ""I think I'm dying."" That's all I could say to them. It's the only way I could describe how I felt. I stared shaking and trembling and kept getting heat waves and sweating. I call work and inform them I need to leave. I get home by some miracle and the family member takes me to the ER. My B/P was high. I was trembling. Shivering. I went from cold to a wave of heat going through my body. Confusion. Felt like in a fog. Etc. They do all these tests and gave me benadryl shot. The ER thinks it was an allergy med (because it is basically like cocaine, their words). My friend immediately said it was the Zoloft and serotonin syndrome. I get released and still felt off, so I returned to the ER. They tell me the heat waves is GERD and send me home. I go to my dr and she feels awful because she didn't confirm with me if I had been taking my meds and said it was the Zoloft but keep taking it but lower dose. I do that for a bit, and I hated how I felt. I see her again and I tell her I hate the way I feel on it. I felt hot, anxious and sluggish all the time. So she prescribed Busiprone. I took that and it seemed to do fine. A few months later, I complain about my depression and she prescribed Effexor. I am TERRIFIED to take it. I did tell her this. She keeps encouraging me to take it. I feel like have such bad anxiety when it comes to taking ANY medication now. I still feel off and anxious. I feel like I have cognitive problems, eye problems now and other health concerns. I have expressed to my doctor a few times now my concerns and she gives me a strange look. I stated somwthing about serotonin syndrome and she said ""I don't know if it was that."" Because I told her I had a full blown panic attack last week due to my anxiety about everything. She continues to encourage me to take my meds but I am scared. My anxiety is so bad, I feel like I need to take something. I feel waves of anxiety consume me when I think of my concerns and what I'm feeling. I feel like I'm not being listened to. My boyfriend offers to take me to ER but I don't want to sit there for hours and it freaks me out what they might find as well. Like if it isn't from when I had that episode in August. I am not sure. I also suffered a concussion June 2024 (a few months before the August episode). so I am not sure if all of that did something. I just don't feel myself anymore. 😔 I will be bringing everything up to my doctor again at my next appointment and try to be more assertive with my concerns and needing something done. I feel like it's all started after these events happened.

TL;DR - August '24 after not taking my Zoloft for several months (due to my mom passing and not wanting to do anything), my new dr prescribed my old dose and I took it (being an idiot) and came down with a slew of symtoms, felt like fainting, shivering, trembling, hot flashes, cold, etc. Go to the ER and they basically think it's an allergy med doing it (because it's like cocaine, their words). Go back a second time and they tell me its GERD. My dr has me continue the Zoloft for a few weeks and I finally tell her I can't keep taking it. Now on Busiprone and seems okay. She prescribed Effexor and I am too scared to take it or any med. But overall, I do not feel right. I still feel off and anxious all the time. I feel anxious because I feel so off. I feel anxious because of my concerns of my health. Cognitive issues, eye issues, feeling off, etc. Dr isn't really listening despite me voicing it. Will try to tell her again. Idk if it is long term effects or what is happing. I did also have a concussion in June '24.

Calling countless therapist offices and other ressources.

1861,My Serotonin Syndrome Experience.,"So I've been on Citalopram (Celexa) 40mg and Buspirone (Buspar) 15mg since 2018. I have this stupid habit where I will just stop taking it randomly and start it back up after awhile. (I know it is terribly stupid and I don't understand why I do it to myself) Well here recently I lost my insurance so I went off of it as I've done multiple times in the past but this time I had a valid reason due to my insurance messing up. Finally I said screw it and paid for them out of pocket to get myself back on track. (This was 2.1.2025) ever since I had started it back up I had nothing but problems, problems I've never ever experienced before.

-Dialated Pupils
-Extremely High Blood Pressure (I remember the highest I had seen when I could pay attention was 173/105)
-Nausea
-Nonexistent Appetite (literally went days barely eating a thing)
-Extreme Head Pressure (felt like my eyes were going to pop out of my head, head felt heavy and I couldn't  keep it up)
-Blurred Vision
-Unable To Focus
-Heightened Anxiety (I already have bad anxiety but this was multiplied by a 100, something I never experienced)
- Uncontrollable Shaking (my right arm would shake nonstop, almost like spasming and I was waking up in the middle of the night with my whole body shaking and there was nothing to stop it)
-Insomnia (I was sleeping maybe 4 hours)

The list goes on really. I was told I had the flu thats why I was feeling like crap, then I was told I had a sinus infection and that was causing my head pressure. This went on from the 1st to the 12th. Finally I was online looking for answers. Nothing was helping and it was just getting worse and worse. Finally I came across Serotonin Syndrome. It was something I had never heard of in my life. While looking at the symptoms, I began to connect the dots. Everything started happening directly after starting my medication back up on the 1st and I hadn't realized it until 10pm on the 12th. So I went to the ER and explained everything that was going on corresponding to Serotonin Syndrome and thankfully they agreed. I had not reached the point of seizures or high fever yet. I was given .5 of Xanax and immediately the pressure in my head disappeared for the first time in 12 days. I then realized how exhausted my body really was. I was drained. I was sent home and was told to stop all my medication immediately. Finally after 3-4 days of stopping my medicine and taking a couple more xanax, I began to feel like myself again. I'm officially almost a week off of everything. I still have some things lingering but it's not near as bad as it has been these past 2 weeks. I was told what happened to me is rare but it can happen. I never in my wildest dreams thought something like this would happen to me.",5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iuhzua/my_serotonin_syndrome_experience/,briannamichele,1740110609.0,mentalillness
1862,Has anyone else observed this behavior pattern?,"I’ve found myself on this sub while thinking about a particular behavioral pattern that I’ve observed in other people. Research seemed to suggest BPD, though within both cases, some of the main factors are simply not fitting that description. I wonder if anyone else is familiar with this, or if I am truly alone as the inconclusive research seems to indicate. 

Please mind that this is coming from an individual treated daily for “ring of fire” ADHD. I struggled deeply with RSD, a lack of emotional regulation, and every other symptom you could find. So, I truly do empathize with all other individuals finding their way within mental illness. 

I may struggle to convey my thoughts properly, so bear with me as I try my best! I will begin by stating that both of the people I have observed with the same behavior pattern over many years have been men. At times, that does not particularly matter, though I wonder if some men may resonate with this (I will add that one is formally diagnosed and treated for depression while the other is diagnosed and treated for ADHD). 

Both individuals are generally incredibly kind, intelligent, driven, empathetic, loving people. When I say this, I don’t mean the “love bombing” sort. I mean the sort of people who are interested in your passions, love to share their own, care to find solutions to your problems without asking, understand your struggles and faults, and are genuinely great people at their core. Yet, there’s something that seems to have incredibly minor triggers resulting in extreme lashing out verbally, silent treatment, stonewalling, or threatening abandonment. 

Both individuals seem to have a habit of repeating their own incredibly negative and hurtful statements towards me during their triggered moments of anger. Every argument would result in the same statement, ending with the silent treatment while I would be spiraling due to a feeling of chronic inadequacy. This pattern became so consistent that I was able to form flow charts with direct quotes that would be later used to ground myself and end the spiraling during my own cool down time. 

Within an hour, give or take, those individuals would return to their normal state as if the explosive behavior had never occurred. When discussed at a later date within a calm manner, they seemed confused, remorseful, and admitted to truly not being able to recall any of these things that were said. Due to past experiences, I am keen on reading eyes and minor body language. So, this is clearly not an intentional attempt at manipulation that I am describing, but someone who truly feels like a monster for behaving the way that they had, even more so given that they cannot remember it occurring. 

I believe this key detail may have been the pointer towards possible BPD during my research; their eyes always looked different during triggered “episodes.” The warm, caring expressions are replaced with something best described as blank or indifferent. The tone of voice is entirely different from their typical way of speaking. No form of arguing, even calmly and conveying only logical responses to their anger can mitigate the situation. It is constant, explosive projection until you choose to provide them with some distance to cool down. 

Essentially, it is almost as if these people become someone else entirely as a result of a trigger and are incapable of recognizing nor recalling the situation later. Given the listed characteristics, I have chosen not to judge nor give extreme labels to these people, as I know that I had exhibited some similar behaviors during my RSD episodes prior to treatment.  

If anyone resonates with this as someone who depicts the behavior or someone who has experienced it, my most valuable takeaway from this post would genuinely be how to disarm these situations more easily. Though I would love to know what others exhibiting these behaviors are diagnosed with, I do know that is a heavily personal thing to share. With that said, please do not feel that you need to exit your comfort zone to bring me clarity.

Thanks to all who read this post, i am really gratefull whith all of you, thanks alot
(Bold letters are the introduction for context of my ocd condition)
Hello all and thanks for reading this.
For an intro: I am a 21 guy Who struggles with ocd since 16. Had contamination/cleaning ocd, Pocd, sexual ocd with violent thoughts. I am in therapy (been in 4 differents psicologist), and on meds, taking antidepressants.
Actually I am having intrusive thoughts about rape, and mental images abou that. Frecuently I have intrusive mental images about a serie where a woman was raped by her partner. The fact is that I am having this intrusive thoughts that are mental images in my mind and I dont want that. Having groinal responses too.
When I had a thought about this and an image in my mind of the man and the woman I do a compulsion on exercising my groinal thinking of a sexual scene that is right and that neutralizes the intrusive though.
Yesterday my parent where watching the serie and the woman appeared. Then I thought about that she is pretty, like is old but pretty, like a milf and started to get erected. Then the thought of the man started to be in my mind and I dont know if was or not a voluntary thought but I didnt stop to get erected. Partial erection.

My soulmate you told me existed when I didn't believe it is at work now; he just texted me he loves me and he'll be home tonight. 
   I started dinner in the crockpot, it's chicken for the pasta I'm making tonight. I can eat now. I don't worry about the calories or carbs or being too hungry to even think about food. I'm at a place where I don't love my body but we're getting there, everything is okay.

1874,How to cope with mental health problems (M23),"(I’m already talking to professionals, but still just want to share my story)

I don’t know where to start so I’ll just start somewhere. I’m 23 years old and for about 2 years now I’m dealing with mental health problems. Although looking back I think I always had some anxiety problems. Mainly social anxiety and some low level depression I think. Anyway, during my graduation phase of my study I started to feel just really weird and unease all the time. I started to feel confused and on edge. I had a hard time thinking clearly and I really started to feel weird and different. It felt like I was loosing myself but at the same time I’ve never really known who I am.

So I barely graduated (about a year ago) and since then I’ve been completely stuck. 

Till this day I have a hard time communicating, following conversations and articulating what I think. I feel confused, slow, empty, on edge, angry en completely empty. I have no emotions and everything just feels vague and dull and completely pointless. Like I just don’t understand myself anymore and I have no idea who I even am. 

Now these things haven’t really changed since I graduated. Although medicine (citalopram) helps me calm down a bit. (Before I took medicine I was basically having mental break downs every 5 min.) but at the same time it makes me feel vague, as if I am not here. It also made me pretty much completely apathetic and not care at all about anything.

I also got therapy, first CGT (which didn’t do anything) and now ACT which is helping a bit more but still nothing profound. 

So as of now my days consist of walks, some meditation (trying at least), some exercise, some reading and therapy (weekly). And the rest of the time I basically just sit on a chair and watch through a window or to a wall in complete freeze mode and trying to comprehend what’s going on inside of me.

I can’t get myself to do anything more than that. I know I probably have to search for a job or something, but I can’t get myself to. I just don’t see how I have to get one. First of all I have no idea what kind of job I want, what kind of job suits me. And I just can’t decide. And second, my head and brains just barely work. They just don’t anymore. And I really feel just like a complete piece of trash that’s unreliable and really can’t be counted on. 

I am talking to one company though, which I got in contact with through a connection. 

But I feel like I should be taking more action and contacting more company’s, but I just can’t. And I hate myself for that. 

I’m really thinking about going on a retrait or something, or maybe turning myself in to a mental hospital. Or maybe quiting citalopram en going for a psilocybine trip. I really just don’t know what I should do.

Does anyone have any tips or knows what is going on with me?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iub5a7/how_to_cope_with_mental_health_problems_m23/,Dry_Raspberry_3613,1740090009.0,mentalillness

1876,What is a residential program like? Could it be good for me?,"I am sure it depends on a lot of things, like location, reasons, general policies and “levels”, but for you what was residential like? 

Specific questions: 

Did it help with things? If so what specifically? If you’re okay saying 

Do they let you use your phones, even just for a little bit? Or is it like a psych hospital where you can’t have any sort of access to it?

How long was your stay?

Do you ever get to leave temporarily then go back? Like if you have pets would you be able to leave for a few hours to see them then go back after doing so

Can friends and family visit? 

Do I get to see my actual treatments team or only the people at the residential? 

Why I ask: I struggle with a lot, extreme moods, severe dissociation, >! ana-r !< (used as a coping mechanism) paranoia, psychosis and chronic/ treatment resistant depression (those are what come to mind first) 

I have a therapist who is really good and a psychiatrist, they are doing a lot to help but mu condition is worsening in a way that I am scared will prevent me from being able to get help
Would they (residential) be able to help more than my current situation? 

I just got out of the mental hospital for the 5th(maybe 4th) time and it’s helped keep me alive but I didnt improve at all
I am starting a day hospital program that will hopefully help but I dont know 

If that stuff isnt working, would residential even work?

Do I just have to wait it out and try my best with outpatient?

1878,BPD as a college student,"
Hi all, 19m here in school - I have always struggled with consistency in my life, having high bursts of euphoria and motivation followed by deep deep phases of depression and self-isolation

It had been very cyclical until I finished puberty. The cycle became more inconsistent, shorter-lived, less predictable. I attributed it to seasonal depression, but it seemed to seep over into other parts of the year. It has gotten to a very bad point, leading to intense self-sabotage at a critical point in my academic, personal, and career development. It is no longer sustainable with my goals of going to graduate school.

I absolutely hate to self-diagnose and will likely not pursue this any further unless advised by a medical professional, but has anyone had a similar experience - and has any BPD medication/diagnosis ""fixed"" or solved this constant inner struggle? I have been through this cycle so many times that the isolation and depression is turning into frustration and rage that despite knowing exactly what I need to do my brain continues to fight with me.

God is my time, but I don’t have to choose what I want to be. 2021 year has brought me too much exhaustion, surrender, stress and emotional pain but I have managed to stand in front of others and deceived myself that I am better, even though I am not sure that my insides are killing me. 

I don’t tell my friends about what I’ve done. I know it was silly of me to say to them that I appeared to be toxic person, but I can’t do.

1880,Why do I feel this way?,"I am currently not alright.

Diagnosis: 

Recurring Depression Disorder
ADD
Social Anxiety Disorder

Medication:

70mg Elvanse
10mg Ritalin
300mg Wellbutrin
10mg Escitalopram

I used to take Venaflaxin and Fluoxetin in the past, but had bad reactions. 

Before I attemted suicide on december 15th I had a pretty bad anxiety / panic attack on december 12th, after wich I pretty much drove home from a event at well over 130 mph over several miles hoping to crash and die, without regard to my own or others lives.

I have since reduced my driving to the absolute necessary minimum.

In the days between 12th and 15th of devember I took a grand total of 8mg Xanax (prescribed) to somehow overcome this.

I am a good person, i really am. I help everyone i can, I buy the homeless food multible times a week, I am polite, donate to good causes, keep my problems to myself and try to not dampen the mood if I ever get forced into situations I would rather not be in.

Apart from the usual crushing weight, exhaustion from having to keep up a fassade and my more and more problematic drinking I have noticed a change in my personality that worries me a lot.

I am intensely jealous of peoples success, living their lives, their laughing. It eats me alive. A Colleague I value a lot as a person just announced she was pregnant. Instead of being happy for her I was angry. Not at her, or the baby, not for any good reason at all. I was just filled with jelousy and rage, for no goddamn reason.

I just have this internal pressure and anger building up inside of me, causing me to retreat even further, fearing I will do something irreversibly damaging to others.

I dont want to commit suicide, atleast not actively right now, but I feel like being constantly at risk of hurting or killing myself.

During my suicide attempt and the following days I had intense Depersonalisation and Derealisations happening, decreasing my trust in my decisions massively.

It was like I could not trust myself anymore at all.

I am in therapy, I am medicated, I just feel like I am going to explode and am scared of hurting the ones I care about.

I am 23, I attended my first and only birthdayparty outside of family at age 12.

I was intensly bullied from the age of 12 right up until quitting my first job at age 21.

The bullying was caused by my pretty bad facial tics, leading to me trying to force myself to stop using various forms of self harm, only worsening the condition.

I have totally isolated myself, only leaving my flat for work, I am having groceries delievered.

I am scared of myself, scared of hurting myself or others, scared of loosing the last bit of control I have.

I managed to keep my coping to weed and alcohol, avoiding harder addictions, including xanax.

I just dont know what to do anymore, my flat is a mess, my car is disgusting, and I dont have the energy to get off my couch.

I more or less voruntarily decided to kill myself slowly through alcoholism and obesity, to spare my loved ones the pain of my suicide, despite how sick and twisted that sounds.

I just needed to rant, get my thoughts out of my head, sorry if not allowed.

I dont know why I wrote this, I just need to talk to someone, anyone.

1881,How do people deal with feeling like a burden?,"I'm currently unemployed, and out of school. I live with my boyfriend, and I don't pay anything towards rent/groceries/etc. I fully understand how privileged I am to be in this position. I typically handle the household chores, although we don't have any children together, I do tend to cook/clean. 

  
Some days I am pretty on top of the general household chores, but other days whenever I am overwhelmed or depressed, I just can't bring myself to do them. I know my boyfriend doesn't blame me for not being able to keep up sometimes, but I just feel so awful for it. I know he generally likes a clean home, and he is working hard for provide for his future, so I just feel awful whenever I can't get some basic household chores done. 

  
So how do you guys deal with this stuff? Whenever I get too depressed to do ""my part"" of the relationship, I get even more depressed because of how much I feel like a burden to him, and how much I am undeserving of being in a situation which permits me to kind of laze around for a few days without too many repercussions.

I know how complicated life can be sometimes. Sometimes, we just need someone to listen to us, without judging us, without trying to give ready-made solutions.

If you feel the need to talk, to share what's on your heart, or just to have a caring conversation, I'm here. I offer emotional support where I offer you a listening ear and a safe space to express yourself.

So that you can see if it suits you, the first exchanges are free. Then, I ask for a small contribution to continue these discussions, but the most important thing for me is to create a real human and sincere connection.

If you're interested, don't hesitate to send me a private message.

1885,I don’t wanna exist,"Idk if this is the right sub but I just want to rant. I’m tired of this. I’ve had suicidal thoughts for years. The reason being, I can’t connect with people. Ever. I’m autistic and I can’t feel full emotions. So therefore I can’t connect with anyone. I can’t form close relationships or connections that easily, even with my family. The one person who tried to do that in my life I drove away and hurt. When people reach out, I don’t respond or try to make a connection anymore. I hate the pressure. It’s very lonely. I can talk to people fine. I have a couple friends and I enjoy their company but deep down I feel an emptiness. It’s like an inherent lack of connection. And it’s not bc I have bad friends, it’s everyone. It’s like im missing the part of the brain that’s supposed to be social or emotional or whatever. I can continue a conversation fine but the soul isn’t there. It’s like I’m a robot. I thought maybe I need an animal of some kind. But I didnt even care for my pets that much. I’m borderline neglectful. And I feel a lot of guilt for that. I don’t have any pets now and probably won’t get any. Even on my good days I always think about doing it. Why bother being here when I can’t feel or love or experience the ups and downs of life. Just a dull pointless existence. In a way the dullness is a blessing. I don’t have to deal with the pain of loss or the stuff most people worry about. But if there’s nothing to experience then why live? There’s just no point for me. The only thing that’s stopping me is that I don’t want to hurt my parents. Esp my stepdad. He’s already dealt with so much loss. 
I don’t want help and there’s really no solutions. I’ve tried drugs, medicine, psychedelics, therapy, self improvement, healthy diet, everything.

1887,Im not okay,"Im not okay

Hey look I’m not feeling too great and I don’t  think I even have a reason for that. I have an amazing life with a loving family but I just don’t really feel things. Like when I turned 16, like the day it was my birthday, I woke up feeling nothing. Not sadness, not happiness, not anger, just nothing. It kind of scared me if that makes sense. I was so confused as to why I felt this way. Because most of the time I can feel my emotions like to laugh and be happy with a joke and so on. I feel like life is train and all of the stops are a happy event and I’m always on the train but I can never get off and so I see all of the happiness through the window but I never fully feel it. Often I find myself waiting or the next big thing or event to bring me joy because I don’t know how I feel. If that day or what I am planing to do doesn’t happen I get very disappointed and am not my self for the rest of the day.It’s not the same as that day but not too different. I haven’t felt like dying or doing anything harmful anymore, it just freaks me out that I am like this. I must say that I used to but I just don’t see the point in that anymore either.I am so tired of feeling like this. Suffering in silence alone is usually my forte because I don’t want others to worry about me. I think I care about other people more than myself. I will often sacrifice things for other people, maybe it’s because I want them to know how much I love them. But I know I would never get as much back.  How could Someone love me like I love them. I’m just me. Someone who never fits in, a fake with no real friends and doesn’t know what she wants to do with her life. Everyone knows what they want to do in life but I feel so left behind. It’s always so hard for me to connect with someone my age, I’m perfect with people younger than me and older. Whenever I connect with someone or become close for a bit, I kind stop texting them for a day, it’s almost like I feel they need a break from me. I feel that I can be annoying sometimes and by the way people don’t connect with me it confirms it sometimes. It kind of bothers me how people I know are so put together, perfect and cool. And I’m just me, barely even a teenager with the way I act. And don’t get me started on my newfound anxiety/ depression the past few years. I get quite a few panic attacks. I am always fidgeting weather or not you can see it. I don’t think that has much to do with anxiety. I am also quite sure I have autism and adhd. I’m not trying to self diagnosed but I’m just struggling a bit and maybe that could be one of the reasons why. Maybe I have a huge hormonal imbalance or something because this all happens before/ after my period. Idk to be honest. Maybe it’s deeper than that I am not sure.

1889,Is my mother bad for trying to pry a bandage off my arm?,"my mum,39F saw my bandage that I tried to hide. (For background info, I struggle with self harm, my addiction is really severe.) And asked to see the wounds. I declined for multiple reasons. One, I was uncomfortable with showing my mum as I am very shameful about this addiction. Two, the cuts were fresh and healing. Three, I didn't wanna risk an Infection by removing the bandage before the sounds healed, the cuts were quite significant. My mother then walked up to me and demanded I show her, I declined again. She then put her hands on my arm and tried prying the bandage off my arm. Not only did it hurt physically, but emotionally and mentally considering it was my own mother putting her hands on me when I told her no. It hurts because I gave her the benefit of the doubt in the moment, but now I am absolutely enraged. I don't know why I let her do that and only defended myself by pulling back. I should have pushed her or shouted at her. And you may think this is the only time she has done something like this once or only to me, but she has done this to my other siblings. Saying things and playing victim, as well as making herself seem like she's the problem to make us feel bad for her. In my opinion, she's gonna regret doing that when she does become a problem. There is a reason she's like this, though. my sister, 16F, has bipolar disorder and is extremely abusive to my mother physically, but especially mentally. One of the stunts she pulled was cutting herself as a manipulation tactic to get her way with my mother. (I am in no way demonizing people with bipolar. My sister is the only bipolar person I have had bad blood with) so I assume my mother thinks I, as well as my others siblings, self harm because of my mum.

I felt so good at first I was with my friends having the time of my life. When I got home I was fine at first too but I started to feel myself getting really scared. Then my mind started to forget everything. Like who I was, how I looked, where I lived and the concept of being anything at all. When I started to remember I started going batshit crazy in my room. I bought myself a really nice necklace a few months ago worth over 2k, I ripped it off my neck and broke it and I ripped a patch of hair out of my head. The follicles came out and everything. I currently have a bald spot near my temple. My mind started coming up with crazy scenarios like I was in hell and this would keep happening over and over again in a cycle as my punishment for whatever I did.
Ever since then, I feel so disconnected with life and like I broke down a third wall I just want to put back. I would like to add this happened to me once before in 2019 when I smoked weed but it was way worse. I lost weight, slept all day and stayed up all night, and took so long for me to recover mentally.

3 things i want to vent/talk about and get some other peoples thoughts/opinions without feeling too judged. 
#1) Im wondering, is there some mental illness that makes you lie about things. Not a pathological liar, I don’t lie a lot but i lie every once in a while about bigger things then i never go back on said lies because I’m in it. Cant just admit i was lying, that’d be embarrassing. I do notice the lies would be things that would kind of get me pity and/or attention. I know it’s messed up and i always feel guilty about past lies and about having the urge to lie like that now. 
#2) i don’t know if this is just me being messed up or what. But i know there is a thing that you constantly think something is physically wrong with you. I don’t think i really have that i mean sometimes when i keep having pain/headaches  i wonder if i have something like breast cancer or a brain tumour or something else that i just don’t know about but i refuse to go the doctor to even get any tests done. But i also kind of wish something was physically wrong with me, that could end with me dying which to be honest i think is just me wanting my life to end but not wanting to do it myself because i don’t want to hurt my family.
#3) i have had a really odd fascination with death (specifically more brutal death) and serial killers. It’s just kind of out of nowhere.

1895,"I’m at the lowest point in my life, is it because of my relationship with my ex?","As the caption states, I’m a mess. 
I’m currently writing this while in a psychiatric institution, and I’m so f*cking stressed, confused anxious and depressed.
Let me bring you up to speed:
About six months ago, I started having doubts about me and my then girlfriend’s relationship. We had been together for 8 months at this point and been living together for 3, and I think the honeymoon phase, at least for me, had run its course. 
I noticed I was becoming less and less attracted to her, and my eyes started to wander. I was looking at other women, comparing them to her and every time I saw someone prettier, I would become very anxious and almost view this as evidence for, why we shouldn’t be together. At the beginning, I was able to shrug these thoughts off, cause I loved her and our relationship was so beyond that. (We met each other at another psychiatric institution for people with schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder, so we knew each other’s struggles and accepted and embraced each other fully, which is the best thing I’ve ever experienced). But as time went on, these thoughts became more and more pervasive and in the end all consuming. 
I started feeling more and more stressed, and got increasingly unsure about the future of our relationship, until thoughts about breaking up with her along with the grass-is greener-syndrome started to appear.
This was my first relationship, and I started feeling like I was missing out on the glorious single-life. 
But I still loved her, so why were these thoughts coming? I couldn’t understand and tried everything to suppress them which in turn made me even more stressed. Every time we were out and there was a girl I found more attractive I would become anxious and stressed, which turned our usual fantastic trips into panic-attack-city. 
This went on for several months, where I ,as the pitiful excuse for an adult I am, kept these thoughts and feelings to myself. 
These feelings were eating me alive, but I didn’t know what to do. Should I stay? Should I go?
These questions were all I could think about daily for at least two months before I finally started opening a little bit up about them to my then girlfriend(let’s call her Talia). 
We tried to work through them, but in the end I decided to break up with her. I couldn’t deal with the constant should I go or stay thoughts ruminating every flipping second of the day, which literally gave me physical symptoms of stress(body aches and much more). I also realized she deserves someone who can love her with all his heart, which I unfortunately couldn’t do. So we broke up. Not a messy breakup , no insults, just acceptance and understanding - the perfect breakup. We decided to remain friends, which I was extremely happy about as she is the best friend I could ever ask for. 

So everything should be fine right? We broke up, I’m free to date and do whatever I want, surely everything’s great, right? No, not at all.

I’m at the worst place mentally I’ve ever been. My anxiety is through the roof, I’m catastrophizing everything, the symptoms of stress remain, I have so many intrusive thoughts, and I’m borderline suicidal. 
Everyday my mind conjures up a new problem, that I have to deal with. Last week I was convinced I was becoming psychotic. I’ve never had a psychotic episode in my life and didn’t either when I had these worries. The week before, I was worried, that I would never be able to feel good again( I was experiencing severe mental fatigue and bodily discomfort due to the amount of stress I’ve been under.) 
And this week it’s about Talia. My brain tells me, that  I can only be happy if I cut her out of my life for good, which I really don’t want to. Firstly because I love her, and every time we speak it’s a blast, and second because I promised her I would never leave her no matter what. 
It’s just that so much of my anxiety is about her: 
I’m afraid she’s unhappy because we broke up, I’m afraid she’s so unhappy that she’s going to harm herself, I’m afraid she’ll never get over me and never find somebody else and thus be unhappy for the rest of her days and so on. 
I worry so much about her and her feelings and her wellbeing that it’s beginning to take a toll on me.
I could be sitting just scrolling on my phone, when a thought would pop up: Talia is probably in pain and sad. This would make me extremely anxious and uncomfortable and sort of fuel the thoughts about me having to cut her off completely, but I just don’t want to. I love her so much and the thought of having to leave her a second time kills me. 
And I also find it so frustrating, that I broke up with her to be less stressed, but I’m even more stressed now that we’re just friends. Like my brain tells me exactly the same thing as when I was deciding whether or not to stay with Talia. Before it was: you can’t be happy unless you break up with Talia, and now it’s: you can’t be happy/recover unless you cut Talia off. 

I thought some time apart might work so three days ago we decided not to have any contact at all for a month, yet here I am almost haunted by intrusive thoughts about her. 

I just don’t know what to do, cause there’s nothing I want more than to be friend with Talia, but my brain continues to tell me that that isn’t an option…

Sorry for the messy, unfiltered vent, but I really lack 
Clarity and I’m in dire need of some perspective.

Thanks in advance

I suspect autism, depression and CPTSD too, and maybe there are others, but there can be overlapping sympthoms.

My problem is that when I talk to a doctor or fill out an online test I have problems with the answers, or with expressing myself. 

I try to make a ""mental evaluation"" of myself, with the help if ChatGPT, so if I go to a doctor I can show this organized thing instead of struggling with explaining it, but I don't know how to do it exactly.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1itfx1o/how_to_figure_out_my_mental_problems/,MaleficentSock7200,1739997467.0,mentalillness
1899,My thoughts on professional help,"I have quite a bit of experience with therapists, though I’ve never stayed with any of them for more than 6 to 8 sessions (addiction therapy, CBT, and DBT), as well as psychiatrists. Currently, I see a psychiatrist regularly, but he doesn’t really delve into my case and only asks leading questions, which suits me just fine since all I need is a prescription. I have several fundamental issues when it comes to opening up to a specialist, most of which stem from entirely different underlying values. I’m not writing this in search of advice or help, I just feel the need to share my thoughts and illustrate, using my own experience, why professional help isn’t necessarily suitable for everyone struggling with mental health issues. The people around me don’t seem to understand my perspective, and I don’t really have anyone to discuss this with.

The most important issue for me is that I see involuntary hospitalization for people deemed a ""danger to themselves"" as a massive systemic abuse of power, and I am strongly opposed to it. I was once a victim of involuntary hospitalization when an ambulance was called after I briefly passed out due to taking too much baclofen recreationally. By the time the paramedics arrived, I had already regained consciousness and clearly refused hospitalization. However, they treated it as a suicide attempt, despite the fact that I showed them medical documentation confirming my history of addiction. They called the police, and one of the officers was aggressive toward me — he pinned me down on my bed while I was only wearing underwear and a T-shirt. The entire experience was deeply traumatic. Some time later, I decided to give therapy a try and started by discussing this issue. As I expected, the therapist supported involuntary hospitalization, though she tried to make a small concession by saying that, in her opinion, my case had not been justified. To me, this felt like going to a therapist after experiencing domestic violence, only to be told that they support domestic abuse in ""justified cases"", just not in mine. From my perspective, psychiatrists and most therapists are part of a larger system of institutional violence, which makes it impossible for them to help me, as I am a victim of actions they fully endorse.

Secondly, I have a major issue with the way psychiatrists treat people like complete idiots, restrict access to medications, and deny individuals the right to make decisions about their own treatment. I believe that many psychotropic medications, such as SSRIs and SNRIs, should be available over the counter. There are countless people who either cannot see a psychiatrist or are so afraid or ashamed that they will never be able to do so, and having access to non-narcotic, relatively safe psychotropic drugs could be life-saving. Aspirin is legal, despite the fact that it can cause serious harm, and I feel like these restrictions on psychiatric medication are not rooted in rational concerns. Rather, psychiatrists — representatives of what is arguably the least developed branch of medicine — seem to feel the need to assert their necessity in order to be taken seriously. Additionally, situations in which psychiatrists refuse to prescribe benzodiazepines to people suffering from severe anxiety disorders, believing they can somehow distinguish who ""truly needs them"" and who doesn’t, are incredibly harmful. I've always felt that when I speak to a specialist, I struggle to convey the full extent of my problems, and I think psychiatrists rely far too much on their own subjective judgment. Some people carry immense guilt about their mental health struggles, feeling that others are more deserving of help, which can lead them to downplay their issues and fail to fully express the severity of their condition.

I also take issue with the way mental health professionals promote the idea that self-diagnosis is invalid. This leads to a situation where, if someone doesn’t receive an official confirmation from a psychiatrist (something that isn’t accessible to everyone), their struggles aren’t taken seriously. There are more complex diagnostic categories, like autism spectrum or personality disorders, which may indeed be harder to identify (though I don’t believe it’s impossible if someone is genuinely invested in clinical psychology, relies on scientific sources, and has strong self-awareness). However, certain mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders, OCD, or depression, are as directly and intensely felt as physical symptoms. When someone says they have a stomachache, no one questions whether they’re actually in pain, yet with mental health issues that are just as obvious, we’re required to have a doctor’s confirmation. To me, this sends the message that depression and anxiety aren’t considered ""real"" enough suffering for people to trust their own experiences. I believe this mindset is far more harmful than the potential risks of misdiagnosis.

1904,Is extreme anxiety really capable of causing this?,"I feel like I have been going crazy over the last 4 weeks. I was recently on upped from 10 mg to 20 mg Prozac during this period, but my psychiatrist has taken me off of them due to increased thoughts questioning every bit of reality and even my own existence. I’m now on day 2 of 25 mg Zoloft, but I wanted to share some of my symptoms and get insight as to whether it is possible this is caused by severe/constant anxiety, or if I should be worried about another underlying issue. I have recently started working with a psychiatrist and psychologist to navigate this whole ordeal, but wondering if I’m alone in this type of thinking.

Symptoms:
- hyper aware of my own existence 
- hyper aware of my thoughts (thinking about me thinking instead of letting my thoughts flow)
- constantly (almost 24/7) questioning aspects of reality/everyday life and overthinking literally every action I do and decision I make
- people feel “strange”
- Talking feels abnormal and distressing. Words seem weird and I’m surprised I’m able to still interpret and understand things. It feels very foreign.
- feeling weird when I do literally any normal human thing because I feel like I am conforming to a false/ignorant reality like everyone else
- unable to watch tv or videos because seeing people and people doing things feels weird
-unable to focus on work or other normal things because it feels strange doing them
-feeling like I am becoming dumb

This is literally the most distressed I have ever felt and I’m worried I’ll never go back to being ignorant to these thoughts and feeling normal and that I belong. I think of my newborn son and the fact that I might not be there for him and my wife because I’ve either gone crazy or harmed myself in some way to escape this feeling. I feel so hopeless and scared. I used to have confidence in things I did and considered myself somewhat intelligent, but now I feel like everything is slipping away. My therapist keeps trying to reassure me that this will pass and one day I’ll simply look back at this time as a difficult period of my life, but the idea of having normal, carefree thoughts again seems so impossible.

1912,My soon to be ex wife is having what I could only describe as a psychotic break and I don’t think there’s much I can do,"We’ve been having issues which have been getting worse and worse for weeks and now they’re culminating into her becoming completely irrational, talking about how her attorney will contact me about a divorce arrangement and that she’s moving out by the end of next month. She’s not even living at the house any more and even though we have a perfectly good basement room she refuses to use it and is blaming me for keeping her away from her kids. Like what?!

Honestly. She’s not well. I don’t really want to go into the whole story but… I feel so powerless. I know we’re both adults and we can all make our own decisions but this is going to affect her two children too. They don’t deserve this.  She’s from Brazil and I have no idea if she has any kind of support system beyond what I can provide but I do know she has no idea what a financial burden she is. She has never really actively participated in financial planning sessions with me.  

She keeps talking about how she wants to protect her kids and this and that and she’s treating me like I’m some kind of criminal and that she can’t trust me around them. It’s wild. Not only is she not living here any more but every time I come home the door is unlocked. I asked her about it (via text) and she blew me off. 

At this point I need to protect myself. I can’t have her filing any lawsuits against me for hurting them. We’re in a safe area but anybody could come in at any time when I’m not home and she’s running off doing god knows what. Even her kids have no idea where she is or where she’s been going. 

TLDR: Sort of venting but I need some realistic solutions for protecting myself here. At this point I honestly feel like she’s a danger to herself, me and her two kids.

1914,Imaginary relationships,"I have a habit of creating an imaginary relationship in my head and getting attached to it…I’m talking an imaginary life with this person complete with meetings and scenarios in my head.

Then I’m devastated when they get a partner in their real life. Or to discover they already had one. I’ve just tonight discovered my imaginary celebrity boyfriend is married which is triggering a depressive episode. I thought until tonight I’d been doing okay with my mental health. 

I’m fully aware I that I don’t know these people and the relationship isn’t real, but I’m still devastated and feel heartbroken. 
It also affects romantic relationships in my actual life because they can’t compare to the people in my imaginary relationships.

I feel so deeply that the hurt of the world feels like it’s my own and it’s pretty crippling. Even if I watch a film, I empathise with the characters so much that it hits me hard. 

I don’t know if it’s some round about way of allowing myself to be sad and grieve for my own difficulties but under the guise of doing it for someone else. I don’t know if it’s because I’m just super sensitive and can just tap into people’s energy sooo easily…

I feel neurologically sensitive too - things are too loud, too bright, to startling, overwhelming. 

I don’t want to care less but I’d love to feel less… i can either feel nothing or feel everything and it’s exhausting.

1916,I'm freaking out because my grandma had schizophrenia and I've already experienced some scary things,"

I'm only 15 (f), and I'm already experiencing symptoms of this. I hear my name being called multiple times a day. I sometimes feel things aren't real and that everyone is fake and doesn't matter. I've had fantasies about homicide and convinced myself that some people were actually not people, but beanbags (like those beanbag chairs) instead. I have to SH sometimes just to feel ""real."" I once convinced myself that someone had drilled a microscopic hole in my wall and was watching me 24/7. I'm scared to get naked in my room even when all the blinds are closed and the door is locked (I've never been SAed, btw). A couple of years ago, I hallucinated that two people were whispering about me when they weren't. 


I recently just found out that my grandmother had schizophrenia. I always thought she had BPD. I'm just so scared because she committed suicide 30 years ago when my mom was a tween. 


When I Google schizophrenia, horrible things come up. Videos of people screaming and being strapped down to beds. Documentaries of people with schizophrenia killing their entire family. I don't want to be this way. I just want a normal life without having to take meds. It's not fair. Idk what to do.

1917,how to find help for relative,"Not sure if this is the best place to ask this, but I have a step.. cousin? Uncle's stepson- who had a psychotic breakdown ~10 years ago doctors then called 'marijuana psychosis'. Not sure how frequently that diagnosis comes up but this cousin has never been the same since. He has struggled to find and hold down jobs since, and has been living at home the last ~7 years completely dependent on my uncle and step-aunt. He behaves in a manner consistent with someone who has schizophrenia- although I'm in no position to diagnose something like that, the symptoms appear to be there: paranoia, irrational feelings of self importance, not eating for days on end, aggression. 

From what I understand, people with schizophrenia can recieve treatment and live relatively normal lives. Either way, it would be a step in the right direction to recieve a dignosis, or some professional help. However, his mother insists there is nothing to be done, that this tragic psychosis incident unfolded in the past and her and her son were hurt terribly and irrevocably. My uncle feels it is not his place to suggest treatments for his wife's son, and she stubbornly will not take him to a specialist. 

It may not be my place to suggest anything myself, but I wanted to reach out to this community and see if anyone had dealt with something similar- how did you deal with it? If this keeps up, what will happen if my uncle and step-aunt can't support my cousin?

1918,I Request Advice,"Hello,  



Since I was young, I often felt extremely humiliated and envious due to being single and having grown up in an authoritarian home environment, and I wanted to torture and kill families and young women in home invasions, as well as in public.  I first intended to do a school schooling due to bullying at age 8, and to rape a girl at age 10 who was a few years younger than me because I was jealous I didn't have a girlfriend.  I have tried killing two people who were bullying me, one by twisting their neck, the other by throwing masonry over a partition as they smoked in a restroom.



I have gotten into frequent psychical confrontations with my abusive father, as well as bullies at school.  

There have been times where I carried knives m in public to attack people, but due to the presence of security cameras and an abundance of witnesses, I did not go through with it.  I have been under law enforcement surveillance for at years two or three years.



My mother is a paranoid schizophrenic with bipolar disorder and multiple personalities.  I was beaten and molested numerous times in my childhood, and I have at least three pedophiles in my family.  My father is an explosive psychopath.  His father is a former petty criminal, both are wife beaters and sex perverts as well.



I grew up very isolated, and my parents need not let me leave the house out of a desire to control me.  This worsened by depression and anger at society. 



However, I feel love and I get along with women well.  I am not misogynistic, and I experience deep love -- I have never used drugs, I have no criminal record and I completed my studies with Latin honors up to the undergraduate level.  



I am not dysfunctional.  I wear clean clothes, I groom myself and I do not give off any signs of being mentally or socially retarded, though I do have a learning disability.  I presume my I.Q. is average or slightly above average, I speak three languages and I live in California.  



My parents are divorced.  My father and stepmother work long hours and our interactions are minimal.  I don't have the money to move out.  My brother molested me several years ago, but has moved out.  He was also diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder -- and he also attacked me when I was younger.  He is one of the pedophiles in my family, and he groomed young boys online.



I am a young white male from a middle class background, though my family is very antisocial and abusive.



I want to hear meaningful advice.  Should this be directed to a doctor?  I am presently in treatment for schizoaffective disorder.  I also have autism, A.D.H.D. and an unspecified anxiety disorder.  How should I cope with this and is this congenital or due to ""*environmental insults*"", as the psychopathy specialist Dr. Adrian Raine puts it?

I’ve struggled with mental health issues my whole life, meds + therapy countless times. I finally found a therapist and company that did things in ways I’ve never experienced. The therapy was different and the insight I learned was something hard to explain (I had two doses of ketamine at specific times in my therapy immersion). After several sessions I went to their facility in NY and had a three day intensive experience. It was the hardest thing but the best thing I’ve ever done for my mental health. I’m sharing cuz I hope others can find relief from the hell I’ve always felt…

1923,A Nightmare of a Scenario,"I was 17 at the time, 6 months from graduation high school. I needed a part-time job so that I have something to do after school. I walk into this pizza place in another town and I see the most beautiful, blonde haired girl I have ever seen. It was ""love at first sight"". She had the feeling too. We felt something immediately. I was caught off guard and said ""Umm..I forgot why I came in again."" She giggled and asked if I ordered anything. Then I remembered...was asking if they need drivers to deliver? She had a smile on her face and told me to just write down name and number.

I got the call. On my first day, the manager said to me ""Stacy has the hots for you I can tell"". I couldn't believe it. She didn't say anything but he told me she begged him to hire ""that cute guy"".

So I come into work. I'm all friendly and introducing myself to everyone. It seemed like kind of a rough place cuz everybody there did drugs and listened to rap music. But I stood out as ""the wholesome guy"".

I talked to ""Stacy"" and her best friend worked there too. All they did was answer phones and take orders. She introduces me and I immediately thought they were best friends. And they were.

Things were going so well.

We were all the same age but they were early birthday people but in a grade younger than me. I was only like 4 months older than them. This is like the prime of our youth. Her best friend had a boyfriend too.

They were both 21. Now I kinda knew who they were. They were obviously ""more grown up"" than me at this time. I didn't have a girlfriend nor ever had one. They smoked pot and did ecstasy. I was clearly in a place I probably shouldn't have been in. I went to church groups. Went to pizza parties. Drank pop.

I was an ""All American good kid"".

One night, Stacy's boyfriend was in the restaurant. I didn't know this. He saw me talking to Stacy and we were both looking like love birds to each other. Hours later, he calls the restaurant asking for me. He was yelling at me and asking ""how tall are you bro""? (I'm not a tall guy only 5'9). I heard her in the background pleading with him to ""leave him alone"".

She clearly had feelings for me.

I was frightened beyond belief and afraid to work the next day. I went in and was quiet.

The love energy was gone. Just like that. She was very sorry for it. I just said ""ok...it's fine"". I still had feelings for her but I was beyond intimidated by her. She was way more ""grown up"" than lil ol' me.

Anyway....

This girl was very attractive and I thought she was out of my league. She was long haired, blonde haired and blue eyed. But she did drugs and I was a squeaky clean looking guy w/ an innocent look. That's why she gravitated towards me. I thought she was out of my league but we went out one time to house w/ my parents there none the less and it went absolutely no where. I didn't make a move on her and was awkward and silent the whole time and ""shut down"" so to speak. I was a nervous wreck. I remember my face turning red and her asking ""can I chew on your red ear?"". We were on the couch watching TV and she goes ""I'm cold and started rubbing herself"". Like the DORK that I am I said ""Do you want me to turn the heat up""? We even sat on the stairs and I didn't kiss her. I was clearly clueless on what to do with a girl I thought was out of my league.

Then we went over to my friends house and just played pool. My friend didn't even show up. His mom let us in. He hid in his room the whole time cuz he was insecure that I had a hot girl w/ me. His brother even tried dragging him out. We both saw this and I saw her face. She looked so...""worried"" and annoyed it seemed.

I blew it.

I took her home and it was the longest, most awkward drive ever.

As you can predict, she got frustrated at me for not making a move I come in to work and it was awkward AF. I was no longer the bubbly nice guy anymore. She even asked me ""Why you look depressed""?

We hung out again but again..I shut down. She made a really strange remark about the street we were driving on. She said ""This is called Lost Boy Street"". I thought she was making a crack at me but the street was actually called that. But it was still a jab at me I think. Stacy's best friend was also kinda spooked by me now. She came off as a ""mean girl"" anyway. I don't think she ever liked me.

So...I guess that was it?

She wound up spreading a rumor that I was ""gay"" at work. I come in and it was awkward AF. I was no longer the bubbly nice guy anymore. She even asked me ""Why you look depressed""?

And well...all my co-workers turned on me. Love at first sight turned nightmare. I remember one of the cooks put two salads in front of me and had a penis shaped item on one and nothing on the other. Obviously, making a gay joke. I was too naive to know what was going on.

Then a week later, she wrote in my notebook ""Kurt is gay"". (that's not my name but just being safe""). I was heartbroken.

All this because I was nervous around a girl I thought was out of my league and got a sour taste from her when her boyfriend yelled at me.

That's when paranoia kicked in and depression. I was talkative and fun to be around. Next minute, I'm a recluse. Then I quit. I became kinda obsessed with this girl. I was always thinking about her and fantasizing about her.

Then I just lost it. I graduated high school. I cancelled my parents high school graduation party and even rescinded my college admisstions to a University. I wound up going to the local community college. I skipped out on prom (she actually asked to be my date in a very like concerned way, it was really cute but I didn't want all the guys staring at her and realizing how big of a nobody I was at school).

I finally realized how much of a social misfit I was.

Then began my journey of social isolation, working at a job and not talking to anyone and only going to college part time.

1925,Bare with me - Just sharing... <3,"Hello. I'm sure many of you can relate - Late 2023 was a real struggle and decided that I would go to the behavioral healthcenter here. I was honest with them even though I knew that it would get me placed in a facility until I could be evaluated. I'm glad that I did, because even though I consider myself insightful, they did give me some New perspectives to look at things. In the past I've put myself in careless and risky situations. Sort of a danger to myself.
I've been chronically depressed for as long as I can remember but I've never really thought help. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and possibly BPD. I have also have epilepsy that is controlled now but has resulted in alot of traumatic events and severe memory loss. I don't think people take it very seriously. These factors have destroyed my executive function - I'm 32 and have been working full-time until 2024, now I've applied for disability at this point and feel guilty about needing to. It's hard for me to take care of day to day self care and responsibilities. I'm also hyperactive while simultaneously being depressed. Stir crazy and uncomfortably uppity, but I've got no interest in anything at all. I pray for a hyper fixation soon lol

A few years ago I started getting ""subliminal messages"" from music, numbers, clues on social media, and synchronicity. I would still say to this day theres physical proof of some of these things happening, but I have a feeling they would sound far out there if shared with anyone who wasn't also delusional. One reg flag in my thinking I can decipher is when conclusions start to become biblical. (I'm not religious). But jumping to weird irrational conclusions was the name of the game.

Also. delusions of grandeur and thinking I was speaking to my higher self... And honestly I miss those things now that I'm not actively having the episodes. The delusional thoughts were in a way my ""friends"" - had to mourn these ideas and dreams I had built up in belief of it. I'm working hard to move past this and simply find happiness in the present moment. To get a morning routine. Make sure I shower and wash my clothes. To try to contribute something to my own life and others.


TL;DR - I'm depressive and frequently delusional, I also have epilepsy and complications with that plus my mental health has resulted in my feeling as if I'm stuck and incapable. I'm working to improve.

1929,Emotionally and financially unstable sibling causes frequent disruption to my life.,"I am f in my 50s with a relatively stable life, married with one adult child and one graduating from HS this year.  Since our mother passed way 5 years ago my brother, who is 37, has experienced a deterioration in his quality of life.  He’s lost a job, cannot seem to keep another and will soon lose his housing.  I have run out of ways to help him.  I often give him small amounts of money for food (it adds up), help with rides when I can and try to share resources for help with his financial and mental health issues.  He sends me constant texts insulting me my spouse and our extended family whom he has isolated himeswlf from due to constant outbursts and name calling. They are older and cannot deal with him.  I cannot house him both because of his behavior and because I already house our sister who is in recovery.  He is having constant interpersonal issues with his landlord, neighbors, and the police.  He was sectioned for mental health and they kept him for three days and let him go.  Three days later he’s calling because he was arrested and needs me to go to court.  I have a job and could not just run out - something he increasingly is asking me to do.
 I’m torn because I am the only stable person he has but I am exhausted and busy with the things going on in my own life (which he is unable to recognize).
 
I’m worried he’s going to have an unfortunate run-in with police where he could be killed or end up on the street in New England winter. I feel for him being mentally unstable but I am unable to respond to crisis after crisis (something my mother seems to have done without getting him help for a clear mood disorder of some kind - of which I was unaware the extent of because I’m older and never lived with him as a teen or adult.)

But for to study further. To enroll myself in academic program I have this interview.

Tbh i really don't have a roll model but mentors said you'll have to prepare one so

Was thinking that being a bpd person obviously marsha linehan is someone I look up for. 

As we know... At first they never called it a disorder, misdiagnosed us (bipolar, ptsd),  called untreatable, mad. 

And then this lady came up with DBT. 
Which i feel is really wonderful.

So should I say that she is my roll model.

And should I disclose that I have bpd and when I did research I got to know this 

Or should I just say that just heard the term somewhere.??",1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1isk3md/is_it_wise_to_call_marsha_linehan_my_roll_model/,DealDizzy8,1739904219.0,mentalillness
1931,What disorder makes you bad at lying?,I had a friend that clearly has some form of mental divergency but never diagnosed. I was in town and we were planning a visit. He told me he just got a job at Best Buy and his shift would be over at a certain time. When I get there he isn’t there. I call him up and he admits he lied to me because his parents were visiting for lunch earlier that day and he didn’t want them knowing he was unemployed at the moment. He then explained that if he didn’t lie to me he wouldn’t be able to keep his story straight with his parents,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1isdgmi/what_disorder_makes_you_bad_at_lying/,shrimp_2,1739887678.0,mentalillness
1932,being depress in a field you hate,"I'm 23F and have MDD with Anxious Distress, and Autism. I'm currently taking a degree in cognitive sciences, but I **HATE** it because it wasn’t my first choice. In my country, the university acceptance system makes you list five preferred fields of study and five backup options. Unfortunately, I got placed in my last choice, which was the only STEM field. All top 9 choices were all Language and Linguistics.

A little backstory:

My depression (which wasn’t clinically diagnosed at the time) was at its worst when I was in a special STEM boarding school. Everyone around me was a STEM genius, and I was the black sheep who kept getting F’s. After high school, I switched to arts and linguistics in pre-university, and for the first time in a long while, I felt stable. My depression and anxiety were still easily triggered since being in a non-STEM environment was new to me, but overall, I was much happier.

Right now, I'm in my extended years (its suppose to be a 3 year course) and I feel even more hopeless. I attempted back when I was in Year 2 because of how miserable my grades were compared to my batchmates and was later diagnosed with MDD with Anxious Distress. Every time I see my low grades, it makes my mental health worse, and I’m still struggling to improve it. Every day, I feel like it would be better if I just didn’t exist because the longer I live and study in this field, the more I suffer.

I’ve talked to my academic advisors, professors, and even my classmates about switching to linguistics, but they all told me it would be a waste of time. This makes me feel like if I keep failing in my current field, I’ll just disappoint everyone. I don’t know what to do anymore. My last option is to quietly submit a ""Change Course/Faculty"" form to change my degree to a Language or Linguistics degree and face whatever happens next.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1isc91w/being_depress_in_a_field_you_hate/,berriesepaicy,1739884005.0,mentalillness

this is not a post asking for a diagnosis. context: m17 diagnosed with autism adhd depression anxiety and dissociative identity disorder. living in brazil. i've been dealing with treatment resistant depression for a long time. i've tried 11 types of medication.

i have been dealing with chronic suicidal ideation for at least 6 years. this means that i spend a large part of my day thinking about killing myself and that i don't go a single day without thinking about it over and over again. +7 attempts.

this is starting to be (more) worrying because i'm having more dissociative symptoms and i feel like the likelihood of me acting on these thoughts is increasing. i want to keep trying for some reasons that are not relevant now, but despite that i feel unsafe and i have a plan and i know how to do it. (i at the same time really want to kill myself and i feel like i'm waiting for opportunities to do it)

so i want to know 2 things: i see people talking about passive or active ideation. which of the two is mine? and what should i do about it? that if i should do something.

these are not possible options: going to a hospital/being admitted. tell my psychiatrist (that does more harm than good. i already told her and she didn't care)

1937,Mental illness & unemployment,"I never know how to start these posts because I feel like you need all of the information, but that feels like a crazy amount of shit to type, and then who’s gonna even want to read it? 
So just try to stay with me. 
For starters: I (22f) am the oldest of eight children, I grew up in less-than-ideal conditions and it resulted in me developing quite a few disorders. I have an extensive family history of mental illness as well. 
I feel like it’s also important to mention that my father & his mother (my grandma) are both unemployed, mentally-ill hermits. I mention this because I find it interesting that there are three generations now that state they’re too anxious to hold gainful employment. 
I started out working at just 15, and worked until my second semester of college. 
Even back then I struggled to go to work, I felt overwhelmed with school, home life, and having a job. But I needed the money, so I kept at it. 
2020 comes around and my anxiety gets a lot worse, and I end up leaving my job to focus more on my college education. 
Around this time my mental health takes a severe decline, I’m in and out of the hospital every couple of months, and in 2021 I was pushed to withdraw from my college courses. 
I’ve tried off and on since then to find a job that I found workable, but I always end up panicking and hiding at home and losing the jobs. 
I’ve worked with my therapist to try and find the problem. It’s like I just feel dread in the pit of my stomach telling me something bad is going to happen (like I’ll get in trouble or embarrass myself on the job) and I’m paralyzed. The only way to make it stop is to stop working. 
Now I’m nearly 23, I’m a SAHM, but I feel constant pressure from people around me to find employment. At this point I’m scared to even look for a job, because I feel like I’ll just do the same thing I always do and disappoint everyone. 
My therapist tries to help me by telling me some people just aren’t made for work, but in today’s society I feel like I’m looked down on. 
Am I a bad person because I can’t hold a job? Will it ever get easier? Am I lazy? Am I a bad person because I’m not actively trying to fix this part of myself? I just don’t want the people around me to look at me like some sort of loser, which is how it feels when I tell people “oh I’m staying at home right now.”

My girlfriend's cousin is 25 F and seems to have something major going on but I can't really get anyone to take it seriously they talk about it occasionally and are slightly concerned but nobody has taken steps to to do anything. 

This girl is 25 years old and in college for art she made two life-size human stuffed animals and she takes them to school with her and they sit in the seats next to her during her lectures she also recently bought concert tickets for all 3 of them. She has a major anger issues and lives with her single mother. My girlfriend's mom says that she doesn't want to step on any toes by getting involved but this girl has hallucinations a lot and one of her friends told her that she had a dream that she (GFS cousin) killed her mom during one of her hallucinations. And now GFS cousin keeps making jokes and bringing it up like it's funny.

She also will allow nobody into her room at any time and keeps it locked at all times when she's not in there and when she's in public she carries around a lock box with her at all times as well and will not let anybody look at that either because ""it's not their business"". Both my girlfriend's mom and my girlfriend's cousin's mom have asked multiple times what's in the box and what's going on in her room but she flat out refuses to talk about it and gets extremely mad anybody brings it up. Not sure how everything is related to everything but all I know is that it's fucking insane and somebody should do something.

1946,Losing my mind because of lack of friends caused by a shit situation among other things what do I say to my doctor to get best results?,"To cut a really long story short I've suffered from some kind of mental illness for a large part of my life and it's only gotten worse as I go from 18 to 19 and 19 to now 20 this year

I've ignored and suppressed it putting others above myself for ages since it seems like a big cluster fuck to fix myself and easier to help others and to add I always had this masculine mentality I was raised with by my father and the area I live in of ""others before yourself, you can wait you won't break today but others might"" which I don't see as good or bad per say

But due to what can only be described as a really shit situation I've lost all my friends due to a partner I tried to give too many chances and they ruined me and my life so now I'm all alone with no one but basic online friends whom I speak to may once or twice every now and then, something I'd consider not really a friendship 

I take full credibility for dating this person and giving them too many chances but I'm no psycho unlike then one who fucked me
I feel as tho it's entirely my fault to some degree

I'm planning to go to a doctor whenever I can get time off work tho I work long and hard and am too tried to even shower most days even waking up 

Having lost everything that matters to me I feel free but not in a good way
Sort of like a helish bliss I've got nothing left to loose but I've got nothing to fight for either 

Most days I require around 2-4 shots of alcohol in order to sleep since my brain never seems calm enough to sleep and when I'm awake I feel tried like I need more sleep and when I do get a long good sleep without drinking it's always interrupted by nightmares which wake me up absurdly early at like 3 or 4am and I can't get back to sleep 

I'm all over the place most days in Mt head 90% of the time sort of disacoiated or depersonalised which has over time gotten worse, stronger 

I've considered suicide during really bad periods so many times that I know the exact means I'd do it without pain 

I'm hyper emotional to a fault and get attached to people way to easily only to always be let down or betrayed or etc 

It's to the point where I've been left so many times I've developed sort of like a voice I talk to as a friend in my head as a coping mechanism so I don't feel so alone and being isolated this has grown more and more to the point where it scares me 

I don't know what to do I've got nothing to loose, what can I do in the mean time while I wait for time to see a doctor and when I get a doctor how to I organise things to where he can understand best and be able to give me something to help? 

It feels as tho I'm loosing the plot entirely

1952,Could I Have OCD? (Real Event OCD),"Hi! Recently diagnosed with Bipolar 2 here. That was after a 9 month hypomanic episode last year after a traumatic loss, followed by intense stress, and initiation of SSRIs. 

During that episode I made a lot of toxic behavior choices and hurt those around me. Got myself into some trouble at work. 

I’m working to make peace with it knowing it was a mental illness I wasn’t aware of at the time and it’s not me at my core. 

However, the last month or two I have had RACING nonstop thoughts about my actions. I have such intense remorse over what I did and how much I upset others. It’s to the point where I can’t control how distressing it is for me — causing panic attacks, causing me to wake up hourly at night, causing night sweats. 

I’m fighting the urge to bother these people I hurt because they all want nothing to do with me and have made it clear for me to stop contacting them. However, recently I reached out to one and apologized to her. Followed a few weeks later apologizing a 2nd time to the person I hurt most — a little excessive but the thoughts were getting so distressing. 

Here are some other things I’ve done in the past that might be compulsions:
- keep going on about something (confessing something) despite being told to stop 
- when someone is mad at me I bother them even *more* , knowing they’re pissed and it will only upset them more 
- rapidly Google searching things about bipolar to confirm my behavior was due to the illness

1960,socialphobia and autism has made me lose hope in a future,"i've been homeschooled for the past 2 years due to my socialphobia becoming too severe to leave the house on most days. i've never been good at making friends, socializing, and ever since i was a kid i've been told i stick out like a sore thumb. i don't know social cues, manners, i don't understand what is socially acceptable and what isn't, i'm good at absolutely nothing. it's simply better for me to stray away from society as a whole.

my parents are awfully disappointed in me because of this, i basically do nothing all day - sleep, sit through the few classes i have a day, sleep, watch anime, read manga and visual novels. thats my entire schedule. i haven't spoken to a single person my age irl who wasn't a family member in at least the last half a year. i'm a total failure and i frankly don't even have the motivation, the skill to change - nor do i see a need to.

each person i meet who seems to treat me right turns away once i get attached, which is why i prefer to avoid any sort of deep relations nowadays. i'm just so awfully depressed, lonely, and helpless that i just don't see a future for myself and think it'd be better if i died once i turn of age.

i think it would be better for everybody involved in my situation; the few people who talk to me over the internet, my family who keeps a roof above my head, anybody who has been disappointed by me in the past.

1961,Learning to let go,"Hi all, since being a kid I pursued physics and science and eventually ended up in an astronomy phd programme at worlds one of the most renowned institutes. I was severely anxious during it, not being able to publish papers, insomniac, panic attacks. Then I contacted tuberculosis and the medicines just fucked up my brain even more. I then after 28 years of my life got diagnosed with severe OCD, CPTSD  and depression so bad that my entire body burns, I cry, feel like cutting my head off, as you can understand self harming thoughts are very much there.
I realise that my brain can’t do complex thinking anymore, neurodivergent ways, my ocd is so severe that I get panic attacks at the sight of numbers. I am taking therapy for it. 
But I am really struggling to accept the fact that I am incapable of doing math and science and don’t understand the basics (tb meds fuvked my brain) even. I go into these never ending solving loops where I think I’ll get an answer but I never do. 

I want help in letting go of this solving I do in my mind to understand math physics problems, to accept my weird brain and do something else with the acceptance that I’ll go in loops if I try to solve. How do I give up control to ‘more smarter’ people and learn to be at peace with being stupid and quit the solving. That’s my therapy hw and I am failing constantly. Any help is appreciated, how did you accept your mental illness and quit solving things? It’s like I don’t know how to not sit with an answer.

Hi Reddit, so I’m looking for some advice on what just happened, like, five hours ago or something. Before I start, I want to say I’m going to turn 14 on March 8th, and it’s February 17th. I live in Germany, and I can’t get a BPD diagnosis until I’m 16 or 18. I’m not sure how the rules are right now, but I think it’s 16.

So, something very weird happened—or, well, to be honest, it’s not that weird for me, because I experience stuff like this often,(1-5times a day sometimes more often) but I’ve never thought about writing it down before. So I am now.

Basically, earlier, my mom was out—I don’t know where she was—but out of nowhere, I started feeling very strange. I was really happy, but also kind of paranoid and enraged at the same time. Then my mom came back, and I don’t know why, but I went to talk to her.

I’m currently on the waitlist for an open psych ward spot. I’ve already been in the open ward once, and in the closed ward, I think, four times. One of those times was for 11 weeks, just to clarify—that was the most recent one.

Anyway, I went into the kitchen, sat down, and said, ‘Mom, can you call off the whole waitlist thing? I don’t need help.’ I don’t remember exactly what I was saying, but I told her things like, ‘I don’t need help, I don’t need anybody, because there’s nothing wrong with me. Everyone is trying to gaslight me into thinking I have a problem, but I don’t. There’s nothing wrong with me wanting to kill myself and having tried it many, many times—that’s just part of who I am.’

I kept saying things like that—really weird things. I was twisting her words around and being my most toxic, manipulative self, which, unfortunately, I am very often. I’m not proud of that.

We were arguing, yelling at each other. I don’t even remember what we were talking about—I barely remember anything. I just remember there was shouting. I don’t know how long we talked—it could’ve been five minutes, it could’ve been half an hour, it could’ve been an hour. I have no idea.

Then, at some point, she was ranting, basically talking to the wall, because I just shut down. I started dissociating. I could hear her words, but I couldn’t process them. It was like she was speaking Chinese or something. I started feeling my hands—when I dissociate, I always feel this numbness, like everything is a dream.

I interrupted her and said, ‘Mom, I’m tired. Can I have my meds? I want to go to bed.’ She seemed taken aback and said something like, ‘Oh, now you’re just running away? You’re not even going to argue with me because I made a point?’ I don’t remember exactly what she said, but it was something like that.

She gave me my meds, and I kept looking at my hands, feeling them, completely zoned out. Then she said, ‘Oh, now you’re pretending to be in a trance? Why are you acting like that?’

I went to my room, sat down for a while—it could’ve been two minutes, it could’ve been 20, I don’t know—and then I completely broke down. I started crying and ran to my mom. I told her, ‘Mom, I don’t know what just happened. I don’t know what’s happening to me.’ I kept repeating, ‘Mom, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I think I need help. I can’t do this anymore.’

She sat me down, and we talked for a long time. I told her that I always have these mood swings—that I either feel nothing at all and I’m completely numb, or I feel everything all at once at 100%.

I told her, ‘Mom, I can only tell what I was feeling after it’s gone. In the moment, I don’t know what I’m feeling.' Everything I said earlier about what I was feeling—I didn’t know that in the moment. It felt normal. But afterward, I was like, damn.

I kept explaining what’s been going on with me and how people always tell me it’s ‘just normal teenage mood swings.’ Everyone says that. And I told her that I usually tell myself that too, just to ignore the fact that I might actually have a problem.

Then I told her about a girl I met in the psych ward. She was 17, super nice, and we talked a lot. Everything I told her, she could relate to completely. And everything she told me, I related to completely. We were in the same ward for about five weeks.

After about a week, she told me, ‘Hey, you know, I have BPD—borderline personality disorder.’ That completely shocked me. I started asking myself, ‘Is it normal to relate this much to someone with BPD?’ I kept wondering, ‘What if I have that?’

I was scared, but at the same time, I kind of wanted to have it—not because I wanted to have it, but because I wanted an explanation. I wanted to know what’s going on with me, what’s wrong with me.

So yeah, I told my mom everything. I was breaking down, crying almost the whole time. And I told her about all the times people have said, ‘No, you’re just being a teenager,’ but I know I’ve felt like this for years—even before puberty. It wasn't always like this though.

So yeah, I told her all that, and… I don’t know, it’s weird. I guess I just wanted to know—I did some research and figured out that what I went through might be called splitting. I don’t know if that’s actually what it was, or if it’s related to BPD, I honestly have no idea.

I just wanted to hear from people who actually have the diagnosis—people who really have it—if this is the kind of thing you guys go through. Because I experience this on a daily basis. It happens anywhere from once to five times a day. Some days, it’s just one episode, but on a lot of days, it happens three to five times, sometimes even more.

Afterward, I just went back to feeling nothing. And I just want an explanation. I’m not asking anyone to diagnose me or anything—I’m not trying to do that—I just want to understand.

Basically, my point is: Is this normal? Do all teenagers go through this? Am I overreacting? I probably am. I know I’m probably just being dramatic and attention-seeking by even posting this, but to be honest, I really just want to know.

Thank you.

1966,Questions about self harm,"Hi, I’m a teenager who self harms and I’ve recently started to become very self conscious about it and I have a lot of questions about the area I cut on. I cut myself on my breasts because it’s the most discreet place. I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and adhd and I go to a therapist for it, but I have not told her about my self harm. My cuts vary in depth but most go to the fat layer. My questions are:

1) to anyone else who self harms there, have you had any experience with a partner who is turned off by it/ bothered by it?

2) When disclosing your self harm to a therapists/doctors and the fact that it is on your breasts, do they make you show them the cuts, or are you able to not show them?

3) is it dangerous to cut there? I don’t know much about the anatomy of the breasts area so are their veins/ nerves that could be damaged by cutting there?

4) for scarring, do the scars there ever fully heal/ turn the color of your skin? And around how long does it take?

If you know the answer to any of these questions, please answer!! You don’t need to answer all of them, just any you can. Thank you!!",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ir8x9m/questions_about_self_harm/,AnonymousPelOnDaRun,1739757753.0,mentalillness

1969,What is wrong with me? (i can only eat packaged foods),"This issue has been going on for 3 years now (19f). I can only eat packaged foods, for example one packet of oatmeal for breakfast, one packaged salad for lunch, one box of pizza for dinner. I eat 3 times a day, and it always has to be packaged nicely. I prefer to eat the whole packet / box. This way I feel in control and ""symmetrical"" and ""structured"". If I eat anything that I do not feel is ""symmetrical"", for example an apple that is not packaged in its own bag, I feel out of control and binge. (I binge on everything, it is awful.) Getting out of the cycle is not possible, I have tried a lot of times. If I eat things that I do not find symmetrical for a month, I keep on binging on everything I can find for a month and basically destroy my stomach. I have tried to convince myself that all foods are symmetrical, but it does not work. So I went back to eating packaged items because it is the only way I feel in control of eating. I developed acid reflux when I tried to recover but kept binging for a whole summer. (When I am in the binge cycle, I binge around twice a week.)

Other issues I have with my mental health:
I have extreme mood swings. Sometimes I am very happy one moment, then a few hours later I have to cry and cannot stop. Or I am calm for a few days, then extremely stressed for the next few days.
Sometimes I get so stressed that I have to bite my arm very hard. This has caused bruising.

I like to keep my room tidy and arrange everything symmetrically / in right angles, but it is not extreme.

I have seen a psychiatrist and she said I probably have ocd but was not sure, however I rarely have intrusive thoughts or compulsions, the only ocd thing I have is keeping things symmetrical. But it is not out of a fear that something bad will happen, I just simply like it that way. I do not really resonate with things they say about ocd. I stopped seeing my psychiatrist after 2 months before she could diagnose me with anything because she was not helpful at all, and my parents felt they were wasting their money. My parents will not pay for another psychologist.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ir1nrv/what_is_wrong_with_me_i_can_only_eat_packaged/,earlybird50,1739737579.0,mentalillness

1978,Voices in my head?,"Now, I know most people have a “voice” in their head that they talk to. Their inner monologue. But mine is different I think. I’m gonna talk about my enter teenhood so far, so I can explain my problem. This is my only secret that I have, and I’ve only ever told one person, but I decided to get it off my chest by posting anonymously to people who might be able to tell me what’s going on with my head.

Quick summary in case you don’t wanna read all that: I’ve got a dude in my head who is completely separate from me and can sometimes control my body.

It started when I was 12 I think. At least that’s as far back as I can remember it. I have had an inner monologue since I was a kid, but one day I started hearing a different voice. Well not really a voice, but thoughts that sounded different from mine. Like how normally you think in your own voice, but this wasn’t my voice, it was much deeper. He told me his name was Matt. At the time, Matt was just straight up evil incarnate. He would tell me to do bad things like hurt people he didn’t like or steal stuff. I often ended up crying myself to sleep because I had this constant evil voice in my head. I fell into a deep depression and stopped talking to people for a while. What made it even worse was that Matt had some control over my body, but only in short bursts. Like punching or grabbing stuff. One of the reasons I feel like this is more than just some weird inner monologue is because he perceives things I don’t sometimes. For example, one time my sister threw a baseball cap like frisbee directly at the back of my head. I didn’t notice it coming, but my arm jerked behind me and caught it. Typing this out, it sounds fake, but I swear on my life I’m telling the truth. Over time, Matt consumed media, read books, watched movies, and watched me, and came to the conclusion that being bad isn’t cool and that he should be a better person and help people. So around the time I turned 13, Matt was an okay guy. But this is where it got worse. Along came a new voice. This one was a girl, which confused both me and Matt. Her name is Annie, and fortunately she wasn’t evil like Matt. I’d describe her personality as sweet and bubbly. I won’t talk much about her because she doesn’t talk often. Over the next few years Matt and I basically became best friends. At this point I don’t fight his control over my body, so he’s able to talk through my mouth so we can converse out loud. He’s also very useful for multitasking because we are capable of both focusing on different things. I don’t want to get rid of him because he actually makes my life much easier. I know this sounds either completely fake or like I’m completely insane and belong in a madhouse, but I’m fine. I’m not depressed anymore, I have a permanent friend, and he gives good advice. 

However, I would like to know if anyone has experienced something similar or if you guys have a diagnosis. No I will not see a therapist or any kind of doctor for this because I don’t see it as a problem. I’m open to answer any questions you may have in the comments.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iqlkcs/voices_in_my_head/,Crimson__Eagle,1739685116.0,mentalillness

1980,21M & Mental health struggles. Seeking advice on small changes to boost self-care & build better habits,"Hello,

I just discovered this subreddit in search of advice I am desperately seeking. I am a 21M and have had a really rough past 3-4 years. It mostly started when I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years in 2022 and my drug use increased exponentially. I'm trying not to make this a whole 'life post' so I mostly want to cover the 'now' but some details are necessary. I was basically a straight 'A' student admitted into a extremely prestigious university for engineering but my crashing mental health hit a bottom. I abused many hard drugs including (and mainly) alcohol, weed, opiates, and psychedelics. Failed out of school in a semester and floundered around for a couple years making just enough money to get high and live. 

I got out of rehab in December and was sober for 6 months. Had a little slip with weed one day in January but got right back on the train and am now sober for 1 month and I really have no craving to use. I now live in a sober house. I am in community college (all online classes) now doing 15 credits and work a part time job 30 hours a week. While I am working on myself with school and work, my self-care is very bad and I don't really know where to start to fix it. For general reference when I was 16 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (Severe), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I also had an episode of drug-induced psychosis in 2022 which I was hospitalized in the psych unit for 11 days.

I do well in work and school but I really enjoy school so its a good outlet.

  
My average day is: Go to work (wake up 4:45am for 5:30am shift), get home usually around 10-1 with a fast food meal depending on the day, do school work until 8-9pm then sleep around 10-11pm. On days I have off I usually wake up whenever, grab a cup of coffee, work on school until around 7-8pm, eat a meal, then lay in bed until I fall asleep around 10pm-12am. I usually quite literally do nothing else besides school and work besides the occasional shower, meal, or YouTube break. 

My main problem is I think of all these things I need to work on and I feel paralyzed. I have tried improving before but did a very much 'all or nothing' approach. Being extremely exhausted from school and work adds to it too. Today I set a small goal of brushing my teeth in the morning and at night for a week and I'm going to see if I can do that.

I find a lot of my stress comes from simply living life, going to work, and doing school, as well as these bad self-care habits. Also, since I am extremely shy, small, bad looking, and generally unkempt/disgusting I am a very easy target at work and home with roommates and coworkers and I really often get picked on and bullied. This just makes my mental health worse.

My main goal in life is to marry someone I truly love and go to school hopefully to get a PhD in something I really enjoy. But these things are not at all achievable with how I live. I also really like music, art, outdoors, and hunting. Hunting was my biggest hobby from 12-17ish but I'm no longer trusted with guns so I am not allowed to hunt anymore.

  
Any advice on things that helped you?

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some things I'd like to work on is: 

 * Get on and consistently take psych medication (I have a history of not taking meds). I'd like to not have suicidal thoughts from morning-night.

 * I am extremely closed off, people don't know how bad I am struggling with self-care because of shame and trust issues (like parents, therapists, friends).

 * Washing my clothes so I'm not wearing dirty clothes

 * Brushing my teeth everyday. I am in constant mouth pain from TMJ, grinding, and bad oral hygeine. 

 * Showering everyday

 * Eating 2-3 meals a day, I eat probably around 600-1200 cals a day because I don't have motivation to cook and my appetite is really bad. I usually eat a small/medium fast food meal once a day. Some days I will gorge and eat  ~3000 calories a day in junk.

 * Getting physically active, I really like the idea of lifting weights and getting stronger, and also being flexible and running

 * Stopping vaping/smoking/dipping

 * Better sleep hygiene

 * Better budgeting. I have +$1500 in credit card debt that I am desperately trying to pay off but a lot of my money goes to fast food as I don't have motivation to cook. I have been better about it though and have paid off $500 in the past month.

 * Treat my skin

 * Being generally cleaner

 * Being a generally better person. Less anxious, depressed, and irratible. 

 * Stop being extremely shy and timid

 * Invest in myself via hobbies, more educated media (not stupid YouTube and video games), and life experiences.

1981,How hard should you press your hands together when lathering soap for hand washing?,"Hello there! Pardon me, but I have hyper-meticulous contamination ocd, and I want to ascertain I am washing my hands optimally. I am not sure if its because I may be using too much soap, 5 squirts to wash my hands and entire forearm, or if I am just not applying enough pressure.... but I can't consistently get a good lather of soap when washing my hands. Is their an optimal way to get a great lather? I would think the only thing you can mess up in hand washing, outside of timing, is how good a lather you get, so furthermore, the only question seems like it could be how to attain a great lather, and through what approach (pressure and direction)?

1982,Has anybody lived through serotonin syndrome?,"I think I gave myself serotonin syndrome. I won't describe what exactly gives me that idea but I am 99% sure what I took gave me serotonin syndrome.

This was around wednesday night. I didn't call an ambulance because it was my own fault, and I had decided early on into the longest, most hellish night of my life, that I would rather die than live, having the embarrassment of being taken into hospital due to a one off stupid moment. I imagined my parents finding out, and the disappointment on their faces. I imagined work finding out. I imagined the new life I had worked so hard to create, just being washed away. I couldn't let myself live in a world like that. So I wrote a letter to whomever, in case I didn't make it through, and I just sat there, struggling to breathe, my heart pumping through my chest. Collapsing every time I tried to stand, my face red and flushed. My mouth dry as a bone. Hallucinating, confused, crying, begging with unknown entities. Bargaining with the universe- please don't let me need to go to hospital. I can't cope with the embarrassment. I can't do this. 

For whatever reason, I made it through. I finally slept after two nights of this, and I've settled down a lot. However, my vision is still quite blurred and I still have to catch my breath every now and again. My muscles keep stiffening up, I feel this most when I'm lying down still. I keep needing constant hydration, too.

I can't describe how bad that night was. I am still unsure how I survived. I keep switching from relief that I didn't die and let down everyone, to panic that I've done serious damage, to just generalised post- traumatic stress of the incident. I'm wondering if I am actually through it or if I've done something to myself that can't be cured without medical intervention. Curious if anybody has experienced anything similar?

And there seems to be no escape 

The thoughts just won't stop

And every attempt to seek happiness

Is crushed mercilessly 

As if underserved 

Every road to possible relief is lost

Every hope is in vain

Every hand that reaches out

Just leaves more pain

They may know or they may not

But they don't understand 

They don't care

The worst of all is I have no choice

I have to live 

I have to go on

1984,Mentally struggling. Suicidal urges have been building for a year now.,"Bit of a steam of consciousness moment

I have been hitting myself lately. Struggling to contain this pain. I don't have a triggering event. I have had the thoughts of ending myself for most of my life. The thoughts are old, the urges are new. I want to start cutting. maybe bleed some of this out. I am not a teen lost in the despair of hormones and trying to take some control in my life. I am a 40 year old who is happily married with two dogs and a decent paying job. I don't know what happened a year ago to make this break but it is here now. I did the things. Therapy, medication, talked to my spouse. I did the things that are supposed to help but the thoughts are constant even during happy moments. The urges are often and growing more well urgent. I am not scared of it. In fact, my spouse is the only reason I am still here from when this started last year. Him finding me... after everything I know he has been through. It made me call the suicide prevention hotlines and the doctor and start therapy and medications and why I wake up in the mornings. My therapist helped me learn how to handle some anxiety. Naming the 5 things with the 5 senses. Grounding myself. Doesn't really work for this. Am I addicted to feeling this way? Depressed, lost, broken. It almost hurts to breathe. Would be better if I could stop. My surrounds change but I don't. I am still the struggling lost child that no one can help. Too hurt to tell why I am hurting. Too scared to be honest so I lie. I'm good just tired. I'm fine just having a bad day. I'm okay. I am okay. I am okay. I stopped looking at my face in the mirror years ago. I look at my hair to comb it but never my face. I apologize a lot. People don't know it is for them having to see me. I don't want to be seen. I don't want to be noticed. I am the Lost Child through and through. I know that if I try once I will try again. If I cut once I will cut again. Momma didn't raise a quitter. She didn't really raise anyone. I was just there. Cohabitating in an environment neither of us wanted to be in. ""Mom are you happy you had kids"" ""No. It was the worse decision I ever made."" I seem to be bleeding all over this page. Maybe if the therapist went a little deeper, I wouldn't have to. Deeper. Femoral. I am not sure is anyone will see this. It doesn't really matter. This is just the ramblings of a faceless person behind a screen. You could be my next door neighbor and we would never know. The hitting scares my dogs so I do it in the bathroom where it is quieter and they don't have to see it. Not really sure how to end this. Ending unplanned... sort of. The first thing the therapists want to know is do you have a definite plan in place. Do you think I would tell you if there was? I will be honest 99% of the time.

This isn't really a question. It is just my mental state.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iqhb16/mentally_struggling_suicidal_urges_have_been/,Moonbear82,1739670376.0,mentalillness

1986,I hate masturbating and anxiety (PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME),"I (19F) currently going insane because its so coincidental. For backstory, I am hypersexual and have been masturbating for a long time since I was really young. I hate that I have developed that habit and addict. I tried to stop it multiple times, but I would give into the urges. 

Another thing about me masturbating is that it always connects to the events happening in my life. After I would masterbate, something terrible always happens follow (could be got a low score on a test or just have a bad day), I dont know when I started to connect the two, but I have noticed how linked it is. 

Onto the present, I was currently on a period of not masturbating for months, but I was really sad/anxious because of other stuff in my life. In curiousity and in absolute tiredness of being sad/anxious all the time, I chose to masturbate because I would at least find some type of short ""enjoyment"" out of it while in the moment. But ever after masturbating moment, I would feel so guilty and my anxiety gets worse as I wait what terrible event would happen in my life. I would also keep checking online if its normal for me to masturbate and stuff and try to convince my brain that its a normal part of my development, however it scares me.

So last week, I masturabted everyday, and then on friday, every hell break loose on my household the least I expected it. It was so bad it was one of the worse moments of my life that I indeed thought of acting upon my suicidal ideations.

I masturbated everyday, because I thought it would be personal disappointments or getting a bad grade, not my dysfunctional household feuding and hell opening up.

Im now more mortified of masturbating, and everytime I feel the urge, Id get haunted of last friday.

Please help me label this or what.

TLDR: Frequently masturbate, and after masturbation bad things always happens. Is it really a coincidence?

1990,Please help me figure out what is wrong with my girlfriend?,"Backstory: to say i care about her would be a massive understatement, we have been extremely close since we were little kids as were our families, through school and into our twenties we probably spent more nights with each other than at home with our own families. We are now 32, and have been dating off and on since 2017, usually a few years together punctuated by a few months broken up. Currently we are together again, as it seems impossible to stay apart time and time again. Also worth mentioning we have both had very hard lives to say the least. Needless to say i absolutely love her and want nothing but the absolute best for her. She is such a core part of my life ( seemingly wether or not i choose it to be this way) and she is jaw droppingly beautiful. 
  

      I have always known something was wrong, i assumed when we were younger it was from family problems, which there certainly were and we both had our share, as a kid she was really rebellious and would mess with drugs drinking and did alot of stealing, something im glad she grew out of as she is in fact very graceful and its not her true nature. She was clearly missing something, but it wasnt till we were a bit older that i realized she had something more going on. She was shy when we were younger but is now very social, which im proud of her for. For more tgan 10 years ive been trying to figure out what exactly what is up... Despite being the closest people to eachother that either of us have ever been, she seems to have a problem with her thinking, like she gets caught up in her thoughts and believes delusions that me or another person she has bonded with is somehow malevolent and has alternative intentions. You can be as good to her as anyone could possibly be in this world and she will still asign negative meanings to the things you do, usually she percieves some sort of 
Negative like you don't actually care about her or are trying to manipulate her in some way or form. She does this more the more she loves me it seems, as counterintuitive as that sounds. She truly believes these thoughts and they come out of nowhere. Often one day you will have an amazing time with her and you can see she is really enjoying you and very happy with you, but quite literally overnight (and this happens alot) something happens and if i am not with her that night by morning she has totally turned on you and pushes away her positive feelings and told herself sone sort of negative story of what it really was. 
    

Obviously this is exhausting and even after decades of relentless efforts to get through to her it proves impossible, she can not get past herself. She means the world to me and i ask for help both for her and out of a desire to get through to her (and have it actually last, and not be destroyed by her delusions and thoughts) 

I would like to try and figure out exactly what is wrong so that i can help her or at least know better how to deal with her symptoms.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iqb74g/please_help_me_figure_out_what_is_wrong_with_my/,Alternative-Light774,1739653065.0,mentalillness

I was planning on getting a general blood test done because I’ve been reading how vitamin and other decencies can cause depression like symptoms. My doctor prescribed daxid ( sertraline ) for a month for anxiety but I felt like it made things worse & i stopped taking those meds because i want to get my psychological assessment done before relying on meds. But I am not sure if discontinuing the meds has caused this, but I’ve been feeling extremely lethargic and sad these days. I feel hyper active and suddenly extremely sad. So i wanted to get my other blood tests done too. To check if this is caused by any deficiencies. I have added a few blood tests to my list. 

Let me know if any of these are useless or if i have to add something. ( all of these are blood tests, no urine tests ) the first 5 were suggested by another doctor long back

1994,Relapsing extremely bad,"Hello all, I understand if I don't get much advice from this post or it gets deleted by mods. The lore of me and my ex is extremely weird, and I'm extremely obsessed with him, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. My ex reached out to me today. He's 26. I'm 25 and female (Valentine's Day). He is on and off with me. He abuses me physically, emotionally, verbally, and sexually. He reached out to me today after not talking for 5 months, minus my birthday (in January I ignored his message I usually don't that to him, but long story short, he told me why he understands why I finally chose to leave and he will never message or reach out to me ever again)

He told me yesterday he's sorry for what he's done. He's sorry for the trauma he caused me and wants us to be friends, but he said we're not compatible for dating, but deeply I believe and know the reason why we're not is because of his ghosting and trying to venture out for new partners while I cry and wait for him to come back and him beating me and ignoring my feelings and ghosting me when I'm not doing something he doesn't like or doesn’t want to do while I give him money and gifts and putting myself in risky situations, though I know it's wrong.
I got/get sent to the mental health hospital over 6 times due to him not choosing me, which led to my suicidal attempts and self-harm habits to now, even when he's not around. My low self-esteem and my struggles to have friends and other romantic partners and me subconsciously remembering my past make me aware he's not actually sorry, and he's just sorry now because he's most likely sex-deprived and his options and new supplies are ignoring him and not interacting with him.

I want my ex so bad. I want to have sex with him extremely badly. I want to lay under him every day that starts with y and take care of him. We took each other's virginity when I was age 16 and he was age 17, and he's my first love, and I haven't had any actual dating relationships besides him. My flings don't really count, but they just don't compare to my ex, and somehow I'm on and off with them too. Even when my ex isn't around the whole time I'm having sex with them and interacting with them in my head, I'm constantly like, ""Ugh, I'm just going to imagine this is my ex.""

He is my high school bully, and he bullies me still. He used to break up with me in front of everyone and then have sex with me after school and degrade me in front of his friends and in the hallway. We'd meet up late at night at parks and stores. He'd sneak over to my mom's house, and I'd sneak over to his, but then he acts like he didn't know me at school and hates me in public and around his friends and the girls he'd flirt with in front of me.

I have/had flings. The only reason why they're around is to get back at my ex and me trying to get away from him, but I can't. I just love my ex so much, literally did, and am still willing to do anything for him, and regardless of the real reason why he's back… And honestly, I feel okay with being used again and hurt again. Even if he kills me.
There was a time when he choked me until I became unconscious. I cried. He consulted me. We had sex right afterwards while he wiped away my tears, and it's like he got/gets harder and goes harder when he's hearing me cry and express my love for him. It makes me extremely sad and suicidal, but I know he's all I can get and have, and no one will feel as good as him.

At times I have fantasies of him taking my life. We even talked about how it will happen. I need serious help, but as soon as he started talking to me again (yesterday), I just acted like I'm not interested, but deep down I am.

I'm insane. I have way more to add to this thread, but I overly explain myself too much. I have borderline personality disorder. Depression, social anxiety, and ADHD C-PTSD.

I'm just crazy weird and severely mentally ill. Does anyone have a hard time controlling their impulsive behaviors when it comes to long-term relationships? I seriously need advice, but I've been ovulating ever since he reached out to me since 5pm, and I can't sleep.

I know all of this is wrong, and I want to get better and do better. I just can't stop relapsing from him. I think about him 24/7. I feel like he's the death of me, and a majority part of me is okay with this, he has my soul.

1995,What's wrong with me?,"That is the question that drives my existence. I've come a long way in life. At 33 years old, I am a wife and mother and live a fairly stable, simple life. Ive made many accomplishment and have managed to quell my inner demons when needed, but I am plagued each and every day by that question. What is wrong with me?
I have always battled periods of depression, anxiety, and low energy. I went through cognitive behavioral therapy in my early 20s and it changed the way I thought like never before. It truly helped, and still does in some ways.
The parts of me that i am unable to silence are as follows. Constant rumination. I mull over every interaction I have constantly. ""What did they mean by that? What do they think of me now? I shouldn't have shared that."" Etc. Etc. I spend so much time in my own head that I struggle at times to be present. I also have a worsening fear of being watched. From childhood, I have always had a very hard time making eye contact, and anyone looking at me for more than a few seconds makes me feel like I've done the worst thing possible. I am to the point that everywhere I go, if I notice a glance in my direction, I feel that I am being judged harshly and that that person has somehow seen every thing that I have done wrong in my life. I know its irrational. I know that people are generally much more concerned with their own lives. And yet the feeling persists.
Does anyone have any insight into this worsening issue I have? Anything that you have done, on your own, to help alleviate the feeling that you are constantly thought of as bad, guilty, or not enough? I am aware of mental health professionals and how much help they can provide. I just want to see if this is something I can master on my own before I seek additional help. I have been on antidepressants since my teen years. Last year I came off of my final drug, and have been without medication ever since. I am not looking to go down that path again. I have kept my emotions in check thus far, and haven't had an actual depressive episode since that time. Rumination and fear of being judged are the two issues at play here. Any tips to master those?

1996,I thinks something is wrong with me 🚫NOT SELF DIAGNOSES🚫,"Please give me advice, I know the way I think isn't normal and it's so hard for me to understand. Whenever I'm around people, I suddenly get so attached to them straight away, like when I was buying uniform for my new school the person who was helping me also went to my school and I got so attached to them so fast even though we had just met and I wanted to see them whenever I could but once I got home I felt nothing for them at all. This happens everytime I meet someone and it's so troublesome It's like I just focus on one person but then suddenly lose whatever I felt for them randomly. Like it could last for weeks at a time and then other times is would last for a day. I don't know if it's just hormones or not, since I'm 14, and I just want to know if I should actually see someone. And my whole mood depends on the person I am focusing on if that makes anything different. I have struggled with Tw:⚠️SH⚠️ in the past and sometimes it was caused by how I felt because of that person. That only happened once though. And sometimes I feel like just giving up on life completely when I feel sad because of them (I'm not saying it's their fault I just don't know how to put it) but then I'll get a text from them and all of a sudden I'm happy and I want to live a long future with them. It could be hormones, but I really just don't want to keep thinking/acting this way so I want to atleast know if there is something wrong with me or if it's just ME. Should I go to a professional? Or am I overreacting??",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ipv8e8/i_thinks_something_is_wrong_with_me_not_self/,Any_Promotion4741,1739599928.0,mentalillness
1997,i think i have mental illnesses,"I have compulsive thoughts. Some tell me to do things others are just random. It can be so annoying at times it becomes extremely loud in my head and i can't focus to the point i audibly tell myself to shut up.

Compulsive thoughts can tell me to do things, like press a button on my controller, turn off my phone, etc. and i do it. 

I always think people are judging me. Every time i say anything i feel like people will be mad at me for it which leads me to being antisocial

i have sensory issues, i flinch at the noise of chewing, skin rubbing together, and loud beeping noises. I hear everything around me. people talking, laughing, stepping, everything. 

When i try to get help something in my head tells me im attention seeking

I often feel paranoid like when i open a door something scary is going to be on the end of it.

things that disgust me are small rolls of tinfoil, Small droplets of liquid, and FUCKING GUM!!

I despise gum i can't be around it, i hate the smell the noise when people chew it the stickiness the fact that it's always under tables it makes me want to throw up

My biggest fear in life is seeing something no one else can see or witnessing an extremely rare event and nobody around me sees it or believes me

My parents aren't helpful, they tell me i act like a toddler when im stressed out and tell me i have behavioral issues.

I wish it would all stop.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ipwkz1/i_think_i_have_mental_illnesses/,MythicToaast,1739605831.0,mentalillness
1998,Need help understanding toxic person/behaviour,"Hey everyone, new here and was wondering if I could get some help with the tittle above. Life is super stressful right now for me and I need some help.

also if there are any other subreddits I should post this to please let me know.

Some notes about ""person"" before I tell some stories. They have ADHD and suffer from chronic alcoholism. They also are very belligerent and aggressive and tend to feel better when they talk about causing harm to others or ""fucking people up"". I can't remember the last time they took any accountability or responsibility for their actions. instead everything is everyone else's fault and problem.

Okay, here we go.

I have known ""person"" for a long time and we have had an on and off relationship throughout the years. I have lived with ""person"" a few times and each time we live together it really hinders our relationship and makes me not want anything to do with them afterwards.

Recently, ""person"" moved in with a roommate and I. I gave roommate some back story about how things didn't work out before etc. We were struggling with money and could have used the financial break with having another roomie. ""person"" actually reached out to me about moving in as our last roommate moved for work. I was against it at first because of the track record we have had in the past. However they assured me things were different now and stated things like, ""I'm calm now, I keep to myself and I don't drink much anymore at all"". Me being me I believed them and within the first week of them moving in I was made a fool.

Within the first week ""person"" was constantly on the phone being loud as possible and let's just say the phone calls were not normal. They were always yelling and screaming at people threatening to slit throats and kill people etc.

One night my roomie and I came home from a night out and ""person"" was sleeping in my bed. I was so fucking mad let me tell you (which is insane because I can't remember the last time I was mad as it doesn't happen easily). I woke ""person"" up calmly and politely (despite how I was feeling inside) They woke up confused and just went to their room to sleep. I however couldn't go to sleep for another hour or so because my bed sheets and mattress were wet from them sweating. 

Life continued for ""person as if nothing happened. Which was also frustrating. Since they moved in they were on the phone constantly and their phone calls were not normal. They were regularly talking about hurting people. Slitting peoples throats, killing people etc etc. always on with someone they seem to not like and there was always something to complain about as if they were never happy to talk to the people they were choosing to talk to. 

I brought it up because we live in an apartment for one, and I don’t need people complaining especially because elderly people make up majority of our building. “Person” once again said “okay” might have said sorry ( can’t recall) and moved on from it. The solution they came up with was to take their abnormal phone calls to the patio outside. We have a vent that comes in and we could still hear “person’s” conversations from inside the building. Imagine how many other people could hear their convos from their patios or people walking around outside. 

This did not stop. other than the phone calls, the constant complaining about everything and everyone was non stop. Drama after drama relationship after relationship ruined and who was the common denominator in all of it? You guessed right “person” was. But they didn’t understand that, instead we got “this person’s an asshole” “this person this” etc etc. 

It got to the point that my roommate and I no longer wanted to do a dam thing for “person” no matter how small or simple it was. 

We invited them to join our sport team for a season when they first moved in, that went to shit. “Person” wanted to fight someone on the other team for some reason the one time and it became a thing during and after the game. We tried inviting them snowboarding and that also went to shit as they got drunk and belligerent. 

They lived with us for less then a year and within that time my relationship with my roomie began to slide. 

We were now having issues of our own that stemmed from “person” and all the incidents and problems they were causing. Such bad energy and shift in environment had us losing our minds. 

“Person was told to leave after 9 months or so as they were on a month to month agreement, we had enough and it was time to take back our happiness and home. “Person” refused to leave at first and felt completely disrespected by the fact they were told to leave. As if we were being unreasonable or inconsiderate of them. They said they didn’t have anywhere to go which was a lie because for the last month or so they were staying with friends and family because they felt like their new home was not a home and they don't feel welcome or comfortable.

Upon picking up their stuff and leaving I was told not to talk to them ever again or they would kick my ass. This came to no surprise however it wasn’t going to be possible because we have common places of interest and id be seeing “person” again whether I liked it or not. They moved in somewhere and was told to leave after however many months and it ended so bad that other people ended up getting involved. They then moved somewhere else I go to visit with my daughter.

“Person” tries calling me to talk and ask for advice but it’s just a cover to actually try and talk about how I disrespected him and how he would never do that to me or anyone he knows. 

Recently “person” told me they reached out to someone they had a thing with in the past to apologize for how things ended. I guess someone else was there and took the phone and started calling me all types of names (which he made sure to inform me on) saying how they want to fight me etc. ""person"" then said I did something recently and kept asking me what I did and said they didn't do anything lately. I keep to myself and like my peace, I don't cause issues with people and don't like confrontation either (although im not going to shy away from it if push comes to shove it's just not my preference)

they then continue to tell me that they told this random on the phone that I am arrogant and a bunch of other things I left no space for in my head (as I have more to worry about). ""person"" did say they were defending me though and was what I felt like using the situation to bring us close again. I explained I wanted space and time away from them and ""person"" told me that I have had enough time and enough was enough. to which I replied you don't get to tell me that nor do you get to make that kind of decision for anyone. ""person"" then tries to tell me about an incident I was made aware of involving our other roomie who slammed their hand on a table because ""person"" kept pushing a conversation they didn't want to have. Saying how our roomie doesn't have a single ounce of emotional regulation or control which is to me a crazy thing to say. I personally have learned a lot from my roommate and for ""person"" to say that when they show 0 themselves is nutty. 

I have had ""person's"" number blocked since they were asked to leave and have recently blocked the house phone they keep calling me from (new place their living has landline). They to this day leave me voicemails complaining about me as a person and friend and calling me all kinds of names. I am not able to cover everything that's gone on as it would be way to much so if you guys want to hear more stories then let me know and ill post more so I can figure out what kind of person I am dealing with. I am not perfect nor do I pretend to be but I know how to take accountability for my actions.

So I will leave you with this, ""person"" called me drunk the other night basically saying if they ever see me again they are going to pick me up and smash me on my head. They continue to repeat this idk 4 or 5 times, calling me a shitty excuse for a friend etc.

They called me twice this morning and as I said the numbers are blocked.

They called me again tonight. Leaving a voicemail, stating how they got hit in the head with a glass cup because of me (again repeating this 4 5 6 7 times) and once again threatening me saying it's on sight if they see me they will cause harm to me so I should call the cops.

I have no interest in calling the cops nor do I fear for my life because this person happens to be a family member. This is not the first time they have threatened me and I would like it to be the last.

Am I wrong for not wanting anything to do with this person and what exactly is this type of person I am dealing with?

1999,Ect for Med Induced Depression & Anhedonia,"I have heard that Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is highly effective for treatment-resistant depression. I also came across someone who suffered from **medication-induced anhedonia**, and only ECT was able to reverse it.

I wonder if this treatment could work for me? I will now share my full story and try to cover most of the relevant details.

Three years ago, I was prescribed Antipsychotic (**Brexpiprazole)**, and it felt like **a bullet to my head**—it completely destroyed my life, even though I had no issues before taking it. As a result, I developed severe **depression**, total **anhedonia**, and an intense **burning sensation** in my head. Later, I experienced some relief with **Sertraline** and **Aripiprazole**, but unfortunately, they stopped working after some time.

Since then, I have tried about 20 different medications available in my country, but sadly, none of them helped. Life has become unbearable—I can’t work or study, and my entire life is ruined and stagnant.

What do you suggest? Is ECT worth the risk?

# List of medications I have tried:

* **Antidepressants:**
   * Sertraline
   * Venlafaxine
   * Desvenlafaxine
   * Clomipramine
   * Paroxetine
   * Mirtazapine
   * Fluoxetine + Olanzapine
   * Amitriptyline

this feeling used to be SOOO much more awful when i was a freshman/sophmore in college. i'd immediately have a mental breakdown if i saw she made a new post on instagram of her living her life. i'd get this really hot feeling in my chest and i wouldn't be able to look at my reflecyion in the mirror for days without crying again. it's gotten better since i started dating my current bf, however the feeling has always been there for me.

she's invited me to her wedding this september and i reaaaally don't want to go because i might just end up killing myself during the ceremony. is this feeling for someone normal? is it just how jealousy feels? does anyone else feel like this about someone? how do i stop? i want to have a normal relationship with this girl because she's a very nice person and i need more friends.

2014,How to approach someone possibly suffering from delusions,"My cousin who I haven’t seen in a few years as she started to pull away from family after she got married recently met up with my mom. The cousin 36F started by saying she started seeing a counselor 2ish years ago, and since then has started to remember traumatic experiences from her childhood. That her parents were selling her to strangers for money as early as three years old, and that they’d also been selling her five year old brother (but not her twelve yr old brother), that she remembers vividly at three years old how her mother would dress her up nicely and strange men would come pick her up. 

Now I’m aware that child abuse is more prevalent than most realize, so I always try to listen with an open mind to these issues so does my mother. There were a lot of inconsistencies with her stories and she would go into way more detail than what a toddler would remember or even understand. This was all hard enough to believe but now it has gone to a whole different level. She claims her parents were preforming satanic rituals and had committed murder by sacrificing her babies (that she apparently had between the age of 3-10) conceived through rape, that was already extreme and very improbable, then she stated that her parents also sacrificed her when she was 3-4 by stabbing her in the chest and that she saw her soul leaving her body and that God spoke to her about how she was one of his messengers and that bad people were always killing his messengers and that he was sending her back to do his work.

We were close for a while in our teens and she even lived with us while going to college (which her parents paid for). I’m trying to think of the best way to approach her to see if she genuinely believes what she is saying. My mom doesn’t know what to do and cousin said so much more than I could ever write down. I know it’s not my problem but she has young children and I’m concerned. I’m planning on meeting up with her to see if she’ll tell me what she told my mom. I know that she could be suffering from all sorts of mental illness or even just making things up, so I’m just wondering how those with experience in dealing with possible delusions would speak to her.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ip5s3n/how_to_approach_someone_possibly_suffering_from/,3dogs-underthesea,1739520281.0,mentalillness

And can go into state of paranoia that sound reasonable to me. Just recently I had an episode where I bought a plan ticket, quit my job and started packing and said I had to leave the state or I was gone. But the next day I was fine. I don’t know what’s wrong. But there is something in me that I can’t control. And I don’t know if I can deal with that anymore. The pain is too agonizing. I don’t see how I can’t get through life like this.

It's not the point of the chewing, but usually I just swollen it cus it feels natural. I've also occasionally eaten change (I've counted, Ive etean two pennies and one of every single coin.) usually I just say I haven't stopped teething and just need to chew.

My appearance has become unkempt, my weight has grown, and my psyche is dwindling, but I don’t want anyone in my life to really know that, after all I JUST got off of my meds and therapy, and I don’t want to immediately go back after making such progress.

I have a VERY unhealthy relationship with food and caffeine, I indulge in binge eating and drinking very often, after all it’s one of the only things really keeping me going, even if it hurts my overall health.

Sometimes I’ll even often hallucinate bugs on the floor and walls, hallucinations used to bother me back in middle school, but now they are sorta just kinda there for some reason, I know this is a VERY serious warning sign but I just don’t care anymore.

None of them talk to me anymore and I don’t think they forgave me and I feel so sick I hurt them like that and I did the same thing to a 17 yr old who is now 18 I begged to them for explicit pictures and  making advances on text things like that and they said no and I kept doing it and one time they said I s@d them but I never met them in person before but I felt sick so I kept apologizing but they got annoyed and told me that they manipulated me to keep making THISE mistakes and begging for picture and that they were paid to but idk if that is true. But now I’m at school and I’m scared one of the people I hurt woukd report me or tell the whole school and I deserve it but I’m scared of being outlasted thought of as a sick monster and maybe I deserve it but I’m scared I’m scared what my new friends woukd think of me how they would never want to talk to me again how my teachers would hate me. It scares me I have nightmares and maybe that’s a sign I deserve to be outcasted but idk what to do maybe I need advice idk.

2024,Paralyzed feeling,"I’m 18 and this has been going on for 3 years and has only happened 3 or 4 times.

For some reason I will randomly going into a paralyzed state where I have no need to move my limbs, no thoughts and sometimes I don’t register what I’m seeing as myself actually seeing it through my eyes (fells more like looking at a picture for so long).

When I try to think (if I’m given the ability to; I will sometimes out of the few be able to process thoughts—talking in my head) my body feels like a husk to a literal sense. 

My body will feel like it’s been literally hollowed out and it “feels” like I can’t feel any of my organs in my body, including my brain and my heart/heart beat. To add more tot he problem I will sometimes not be able to breath or blink so it looks like I’m either going into cardiac arrest or I’m just dead. And this issue can last up to a minute or so.

One time during an episode my friend literally (jokingly-kinda) slapped me hard across the face but I didn’t register the pain nor flinched or even blinked, I just kinda fell over on the couch. 

I just want to know if this is an actual thing that probably needs checked out or if I’m just going crazy or if anyone else feels like this.

My mom (who studied psychology) says it looks (from her perspective) like anxiety paralysis or Quadriplegia.

Me and my boyfriend have been having a lot of problems lately and our relationship is honestly pretty toxic within the past month. We’re taking a break from seeing each other for a few days but in November we started looking at houses and talked about starting a family in the next year or two. It seems so far away now.

2032,How to be happy,"So I’m thinking about suicide, already wrote letters for my family and the few friends I have.
All my life I felt like I’m not included, I feel like i don’t have control anymore. I regret so many choices, its hunting me daily. It killed me to the point where i became numb
. I have a lot of trauma including early childhood trauma. Maybe since 4 years or so Bi-Polar Depression, I never checked. I‘ve always wanted to be an psychologist to understand me more and help others. I lost this dream a long time ago, and I’m currently working a job I just kinda fell into.
I have no one really supportive. I have barely friends. And I’m not able to talk to someone about my problems. 

Everyday I feel miserable and I fell into some addictions that keeps me living. 
But I just can’t anymore, the crying for hours, the sudden mood changes, the feeling of not being enough, not being worthy being around.
I‘ve always wanted a girlfriend to support me
Tomorrow is Valentines day, and maybe the last one for me. 
I know though saying that, but going into therapy would ruin me, sitting infront of my dreams, sitting infront of something I never hoped to sit. Thinking: „in another life it would be me sitting there and helping people, and now watch you, you achieved nothing, all these years, all these empty promises“


I know a lot of psychology, but I‘m tired I did everything a psychologist could recommend for selfhealing. At night I‘m dreaming of someone taking care of me, hugging me and being there for me. 
I can’t remember when I last was really happy. I think it all started years ago. The feeling I’m never enough, the inner voices in my head telling me that over again.

I know the bright sides of life, I know the consequences. I know someoneday it will get better. But i don’t know if i can take it anymore, I’m so damaged i don’t know if I’ll ever be able to be myself and feel comfortable around anyone. 
I had a best friend, but I got unimportant, I’ve asked why, and he never told me. Maybe he didn’t want to hurt me, but that’s with every person. They somehow lose interest. It hurts because I try everything to be liked. 

I’m losing day to day more concentration, confidence, hope, sleep. I tried my hardest to get better. 

I hope that maybe in another life everything works out and I found my spark. I wish everybody that read through all of this, just the best

2036,do i tell my therapist?,"tw // talk of eating disorders, substance abuse, SH, SI and attempts

hello, so i’m 17f and a senior in high school. i have had worsening depression since the beginning of my junior year and it sort of is always there but the severity comes and goes. 

i’ve struggled with SI off and on since i was about 10 years old, and i’ve also struggled with eating disorders since 10 as well which has heavily contributed to my SI recently even though i’m in recovery once again. recently i’ve developed some issues with substances as well (marijuana and alcohol), marijuana is less of an issue for me because when i do get hooked on it i don’t find it too hard to stop when i need to, but i’ve been drinking a lot more recently (stealing alcohol from my parents any chance i can get) which i know is a huge sign of developing alcoholism. substance issues run on both sides of my family. 

at the beginning of my junior year which was now about and a half ago i started seeing my therapist, she’s really nice and understanding. i haven’t seen her since june 2024 but i asked my mom to make me an appointment with her because my depression has started to get a lot worse, worse than it’s ever been. i find myself using substances/binging and purging/SH to cope with these feelings because regular coping mechanisms aren’t enough for me. i’ve always struggled with managing my emotions ever since i was a child.

so for the past few weeks i’ve been thinking a lot about suicide. it has been really heavy on my mind and even that is really hard to cope with sometimes. i know i’m loved by so many people, but the pain is just so intense and my confidence and outlook on life are completely destroyed. my first attempt was in august 2024, and my second in january 2025, won’t go into detail with those, just keep that in mind. both attempts were with the same method, but for the past week i have been seriously planning another attempt and i plan to go through with it within the next few days. 

i found a cord long enough to tie to my door hinge and i’ve tied the knot and tested it a few times to see how it feels, so i do have a solid concrete plan in place. i don’t want to go through with it because i have a little sister (13f) and i’m the first born in my family so it would devastate my parents and the rest of my family. but i have to go through with it. the thought of eternal peace is so tempting, i won’t have to deal with anything ever again. i don’t know how to cope with these thoughts so that’s the number one reason why i’m going to commit. 

i really don’t want to do this, i have a therapy appointment today, do i tell my therapist about this? i know that they’ll notify my parents and i know that my parents will completely freak out and i’m scared that they will be angry. but i’m also scared for myself, that i’m going to go through with this and nothing can stop me right now. do i also tell my therapist about my substance abuse issues? what do i do? will i be hospitalized?

Today, we didn’t talk much like we usually do. I texted her, and we talked about what happened just a little bit because I asked if she was mad. She basically said I was selfish (rightfully so) and she needed to take time to protect herself.

When he was a child he would hit himself until he threw up as a form of punishment. He zones out a lot.  He has this sense of impending doom. Periods of lack of empathy. And always remembers arguments differently than I do. He was put on one medication and he said he felt like his skull was on fire.  So they took him off it.  And we have a baby together. I have ptsd and my anxiety over this is through the roof. ,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iok6m6/help_me/,ShilohsMom92,1739456776.0,mentalillness
2042,Is it possible that I might be borderline?,"Once, my psychiatrist told me that borderline personality disorder is mainly centered around active sexual life, impulsivity, and the need to have some form of ""sexual appeal."" In my case, I don’t have an active sex life because I take anxiolytics and birth control, which reduced my libido. Nowadays, I no longer feel the urge to engage in sexual relationships with others, although I’ve had relationships in the past.

I suspect that I might have borderline personality disorder, but since the sexual aspect isn’t important to me, the psychiatrist said it’s unlikely that I have the disorder. Also, I don’t abuse substances like drugs or alcohol.

The signs I identify with are emotional dependence, fear of abandonment, impulsivity in some areas, like shopping, not thinking much about the consequences, excessive and unfounded anger, mood swings, among others.

2043,I feel like dying. Is this the end?,"I‘ve been having rough days. Not being able to sleep a few days, then a little bit, then sleeping 40 hours. This repeated up to the point were days felt like minutes. I feel like i‘m slowly fading more and more.

I‘m sitting on my bed. My room is messy. Everything is dirty, i feel shame.

I just thought about my childhood, knowing i once was able to feel. I know what it feels like… but why can’t i feel it anymore… its been so long…. It gets worse everyday. I have some kind of ceiling stilt in my room, next to my bed. I just touched it and started crying. Why can‘t i feel it? I‘m touching it? It feels like a cloud that you’re able to touch but not hold. I started crying.

These days i‘ve been not able to carry myself in any way. No food, water, hygiene. I always throw everything up even if i try to eat. I‘ve spent these last two weeks vomiting crying and thinking about suicide, nothing else.

I‘m on the waiting list for psych ward, i don‘t want to go to normal hospitals. I just can‘t stay there. I‘m on the waiting list for a special one, a more humane one. A place where i‘d say it would be worthy to die. More worthy than where i am now.

I‘ve been talking to my friends, clearing up past fights and rumors that were going around, just to not take it into the afterlife.

I‘m fading. I‘m slowly dying, i know it. Is this this the end? I‘m only 20. i won‘t kill myself thats my promise. I wont put the pain on anyone my parents put on me. But it‘s hard. I guess at one point the body just can‘t take it anymore. 20 years. I know it‘s not alot but i have experienced everything i wanted to. It‘s okay. I want to go. Just make it stop hurting.

2044,Appt with MH Nurse was Traumatic,"TW: Abortion, Abuse 


EDIT - I’m currently on Venlaflaxine and Quetiapine

Had a first appointment with MH nurse from neighbourhood mental health team yesterday following being referred as Iapt service found my needs higher than their remit for low mood/anxiety. This is due to several years of major depressive disorder and anxiety following several traumatic events throughout childhood and adulthood.

I spoke about being coerced into an abortion at 17 by an abusive partner. The nurse went on to comment that “the baby would have been quite big by that stage” and asked what kind of procedure I had to end the pregnancy?

The nurse then made a number of comments around the service not potentially being suitable as I said I feel I might be neurodivergent and gave an example “A patient with autism I saw masked the whole time and would focus on one thing I said during appointments rather than everything else said”. 

I found this so unhelpful, I have no diagnosis and I’m currently waiting for an ADHD assessment. 
The nurse signposted me to a charity who do crafting and other activities for women with autism. 

Am I missing something or does this feel like a reductive and insensitive approach? I struggle to advocate for myself but reflecting on yesterday I don’t feel this was appropriate, I understand the NHS is stretched and being a mental health nurse must be a challenging job.

2049,panic attacks unbearable,"Hi guys, 

I have been taking Xanax (alprazolam) for about 8 years now. no consistent dosage, usually 0.5mg whenever I have a panic attack. sometimes once a day, sometimes 3 times a day. at times I would take 1mg but never more, which I believe is a relatively small dosage. 

for the past 3 weeks I've been suffering from severe panic attacks, chest pains, difficulty breathing, heart palpitations etc due to loads of family and relationship stress. I have subsequently been taking 1mg about 3 times a day and the moment it starts wearing off, the physical symptoms return and I need to re-dose.  it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack, the left side of my body goes numb, my sinuses close up, and I am out of breath if I don't take it. I don't know what to do anymore and can't take off work. today I took 1mg of Xanax and 5mg of diazepam and I guess the fear and anxiety are exacerbated as I don't want to OD. I don't know what to do and I would appreciate any advice. 

my diet has gone down the drain, my motivation is at an all time low and I cant cope with the physical symptoms of anxiety/panic attacks anymore. 

has anyone else experienced this and are there any professionals that could possibly advise me.

I don't think this is bad of him. I get that some people need to talk about it with others more and need more support. Only thing is I also feel sad and anxious all day every day all the time. Barely experiencing happiness yk. Hate to sound overdramatic buts that's just what it is yk. But what I do is completely act super upbeat, loud, happy and goofy/weird to not seem sad.

2054,"Not ready for a relationship, or is it BPD or adderall?","
Some background, me (21f) and my coworker (20m) became friends last month and we hit it off pretty well to begin with. So well we admitted to each other that we like each other! I even made sure I waited because before I even told him I was freaking myself out into thinking that i wasn’t into him. Or that we weren’t going to work out, which is a bad self defense mechanism I have. Basically stopping myself from even trying. 

We first started hanging out as friends, then after we told each other how we felt we started hanging on Saturdays, some cuddling and small lewd jokes here and there but nothing too romantic. We don’t have labels yet, just dating status. During this time though, I saw all these things that for some reason just didn’t sit with me. He is extremely immature and makes dumb jokes, he’s clingy and very…I guess noisy/soft? Like he makes noises to affection, and kinda does too much. Which I haven’t experienced since my first highschool boyfriend lol. It’s not the worst but unfortunately it just kind of makes me cringe here and there but I try to ignore it. It’s not like it’s hurting me. He also isn’t in therapy and is very much needy for reassurance, self deprecating and just overall has some issues. I try to support him but I’ve expressed that I cannot fix him and I’m not his therapist. 

Even after all these things I still want to try to have him as my boyfriend. I think a lot about us hanging out or him coming to my family’s on holidays, stuff like that. I even was so excited that I finally had a crush on someone because before this guy, I went on dates here and there but never felt a spark. I was scared there was something wrong with me. I felt emotionless. 

Now recently, for some reason. After knowing we like eachother and hanging out, I’m scared about the future. I’ve been focusing on all the negatives, like his mental issues and things he needs to work on. What if he’s too immature, what if we’re not compatible…SO many things. Then I think about what if I’m not available? Too negative? I see myself getting upset between 11am-3 to 5pm, like an hour after I take my adderall (and lamictal) I worry so much and feel miserable. Then by 6-11pm I start to feel a bit better and more positive. I felt like I was more happy about us when I had a crush on him. Sometimes I feel like I’m in a euphoric state out of no where. I don’t know if it’s med related. Even focusing on the negatives, I still for some reason don’t want to give up. Like I want to try a relationship, I want to give us a chance. Yet whenever I try to think of the positives I feel like my brain is yelling at me to accept that I can’t be helped, or that I’m trying to avoid my feelings. I wish I could give him a straight yes or no to a relationship.

(I’ve been on the second lowest dose of lamictal for 3 months now, and just started adderall last month)

So at the end of november i believe i went into some sort of psychotic episode for about 2 weeks. A lot of stuff happened, and i had a lot of bad thoughts, but there was a particular idea that got stuck in my head. Without getting too detailed, i desperately wanted to cut myself below my left eye. I would trace a knife across the area. Ive never seld harmed before even when deeply deppressed, and this urge wasnt a suicidal/depression thing...idk what it was i cant describe it but it was almost like a instinctual desire. Senarios and images would flash through my head all day every day.

Luckily i never went through with anything and got out of whatever episode i was having, but a few weeks later i started abusing dxm meds. It was a slippery slope and now im an addict on some level

Heres where the issue is, over the past 2 weeks or so, whenever i try to go to bed sober i have the same thoughts about my eye, such an urge. Over the past few days even during the daytime im thinking about it and have gotten paranoid again. Only on dxm can i stop thinking about it.

2056,I had serotonin syndrome and doctors had no idea,"I talked to a therapist/nurse that would prescribe me medication for my anxiety that i’ve had since I middle school. I was given citalopram (celexa) 20mg daily and I had no issues for a long time. I noticed that it decreased my sexual desire after a few years so I made another appointment with the same doctor and talked to her about it.

She decided to prescribe me Wellbutrin to combat this side effect along with the citalopram I was already taking. I was a little hesitant to take a new medication because she told me there could be side effects but that it is safe to do. I took one of the pills and noticed nothing wrong for the first few days. A few days later I noticed I was light headed, but it kinda felt like I was high on drugs. Like I took ecstasy but I only had the feeling in my brain and not in my body. People might say “oh that sounds great!” But it was NOT. I was also nauseous, i couldn’t eat for days, constantly trembling (shaking violently) and my heart felt like it was going to pound out of my chest. Of course I was constantly crying.

After a few days of this and missing work on medical leave, I finally convinced my fiance to take my to the hospital. I got there and waited for 6 hours for them to tell me im absolutely fine and sent me home. I knew I wasn’t fine. Something was wrong and everyone around me thought I was going crazy. 

After dealing with this for WEEKS. I begged my mom to take me to the hospital again because I could not sleep and I haven’t eaten in days. I was extremely dehydrated and malnourished. Every time I tried to go to sleep my brain would like zap me in a way, jolting my body awake. I felt like I was out of hope and was getting suicidal. My mom refused to take me to the hospital because they wouldn’t do anything. I was losing my mind. Nobody believed me. My fiance finally woke up and told my mom that he is taking me and that he doesn’t care what my mom thinks. It really shows the type of person he is.

I was only in the waiting room for a few minutes because I was crying really loudly so they gave me a room. I told them what was going on and that I was exhausted and just wanted to be able to sleep. Keep in mind I was saying this as my body was violently shaking. The doctor came in with 5mg of Ativan and told me to take it. Of course I was terrified to take anything else after what I’ve been going through. They gave me Ativan, let me sleep for a few hours, and sent me home. No diagnosis. No answers.

I was prescribed a bottle of Ativan and took it when I needed to sleep but I’d still have panic attacks all the time because my brain felt like it was going to explode. Eventually it went away, but after doing research I’ve come to the conclusion that I had serotonin syndrome. And nobody cared. I’m sharing this to spread awareness.

It was obvious from the start. I never talked to her cuz I'm way too paranoid I'll come off as a ""creep"". But I also have the problem of ""fear of success"". I'm afraid I'll come off as ""very hot"". So anyway, I guess she has a liking to me as I suspected. She always smiled at me and giggled w/ her co-workers when I walk by.

But there's a problem. I hate myself. I don't wanna go back there ever again. Once she really gets to know me (living at home still, going to job interviews cuz I'm unemployed, mental illness, got bullied in school, had a psychotic episode in the middle of a college class, always feeling like I'm worthless and better off dead so that the normal people can live, etc), then she'll regret ever showing an interest in me.

It's happened before. This one girl, who had bit of a ""hard edge"" to her, loved my innocent boyish look. Then she admitted ""Yeah, I looked at you and thought OMG so cute...then I talked to you and said OMG what a friggin dork!"".

And she was right. It's like there's certain breeds of people in school environments. You have the cool kids who party, still do good in school, lots of friends, no matter how bad they do, they'll still be successful in this economy...then there's me...who have maybe 2 friends who are dorks like me and struggle daily. I think she thought I could possibly be ""one of the cool kids"" but obviously, I didn't have it in me.

I don't understand why I attract these types who get some sadistic pleasure in toying w/ me sexually? ""I'm gonna take this guy's innocence away"". I guess I understand it. But it freaks me out.

There's been other instances obviously too but that one stands out the most. When I was in college, I decided to ""opt out"" of the social scene and just be a studious person. Yeah well...that didn't do me any good. All the cool kids are probably killing it right now, no matter how crappy they did in school and me living at home still.

I honestly feel like a genetic inferior. And my whole purpose is to be a play toy for these alpha types (guy or girl).

    He got into heroine at 18 to deal with his family. Him and his ex were both addicts. She emotionally abused him. He has been on methadone for 10 years but completely free of heroine, maybe 5. He is to do it socially when he was no longer supposedly addicted.
    He has ptsd, anxiety, and panic disorder, and God knows what else that just isn't diagnosed. He doesn't take care of his health or how he looks

He doesn't live. For 4 years, I've had to yell at him to clean, cook, and take care of our pets.  Nothing gets done on his own. Even if i yell, not everything gets done. He wants a daughter badly. I can't imagine how he thinks that's a good idea. Even after yelling every day, threatening to leave, attempting to leave, telling him he's making me depressed and considering suicide, he still doesn't change. He even walks out of the house with his hair matted. I thought once he saw ""professionals,"" he would get better, which is why I stayed so long.

I feel very empty. 
But I do feel very happy when I think about hurting myself or other people. 
I am not a masochist or a sadist, theses things doesn’t excite me in any way, theses thoughts just make me feel happy. 

I think that I am going to hurt myself tonight and I don’t know what to do. 

I know theses things aren’t healthy and I really want to be a normal person. 

I want a normal life, I want to be happy and healthy.

2070,Why do I want trauma?,"I guess some people would say I have trauma. I was spanked until I was around 10-11, then my dad stopped spanking and started hitting me in the head with his fists, it never hurt too bad, just made my head throb a little. He also likes to pretend he’s going to hit me, just to make me flinch. My dad was also pretty explosive, I got yelled at most days when I was a kid, most of my memories are of me sitting in my room, screaming and crying. I’ve thought about if I have repressed memories, I really doubt it though. As a kid I also had violent thoughts, when I was around 6/7 I would stand at the top of the stairs and image I was throwing a baby down them. I liked when babies cry, I don’t know why. I would also watch sad videos in my free time. From 3rd to probably 6th grade I spent all of my time watching videos on childhood cancer, i liked that it was tragic. I still like to see people in sad situations. I began experiencing homicidal ideation when I was 13. I still have dreams where I’m hurting little kids, I don’t mind them. I just bring all of this up because I was wondering if these strange thoughts were signs that I was being physically abused. Although from what I can remember, the “abuse” was never that bad. A lot of people have it so much worse. I’m 17 now and I practically fantasize about being abused, when I’m watching a show and a father is abusing his kids, I feel jealous, I have no idea why. I can’t understand when people have empathy for kids, kids are not innocent, they are selfish and horrible, they only cause problems. I understand people who abuse kids. I could never have kids because I would hurt them.

2074,I don't miss people,"Hi, I'm a 26/F with Autism, depression, and PTSD

I've noticed that I don't miss people in the same way others do. I'm content with my own company, and I don't feel the need to stay in touch with family or friends often. This has lead to people believing I don't care about them, or thinking I don't miss them. I do think about them, and I hope they're doing well, I just don't feel the need to call or message them all the time. I can go months without talking to someone and then pick right back up where I left off with them when I see them again.

Recently my sister came to visit from out of state after running away for 2 years. I missed her a lot, but didn't really message her. I cried when she got here and hugged her for 3 minutes straight, so I know in my heart that I *DID* miss her and was happy she was home, but in the time she was gone, I didn't really feel the need to reach out. I do the same thing with my bio dad, my former stepdad, my other siblings, and my old, close friends. I don't really talk to anyone other than the people in my household, and my online friends. It's like if someone is out of sight, for the most part, they're out of mind until I see them again.

Whenever a friend leaves my friend group, I might be disappointed, but I get over it quickly. And if they leave by fading out slowly, I probably won't even notice much unless someone else brings them up again in conversation.  
*""What ever happened to  _ _ _ _?""*  
*""Oh, I'm not sure. I hope they're doing okay.""* type of thing. But if I see them again, I'm happy to, and I'll chat with them and ask them how they've been.

I'm okay with people coming and going from my life, as long as my brain believes it's not permanent. The only people I truly miss, in the typical sense of the word, are the ones I can't reach out to. Loved ones that have passed away, or friends I know I'll never speak to again. As long as I know someone is okay, and accessible, I don't miss them much, because I know I'll probably see them again at some point.

Does anyone else experience this? What could it be? An attachment issue, or something to do with my autism? I know nobody here can give me a definitive answer, but maybe some ideas?",14,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ini8x7/i_dont_miss_people/,x0Wallflower0x,1739332719.0,mentalillness
2075,Just a little rant really,"I was diagnosed with ASD as a toddler, then diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 at age 17, my mom's poor health caused her to nearly die 3 times already during my own life which has a big impact on my mental health so that probably caused an undiagnosed condition too at this point. As a result of the ASD and me struggling immensely as a kid over my mom's near death experiences, I was severely bullied in primary school to the point where I straight up refused to talk, and when I did talk I tried to be as mean and vile as possible to keep people away from me. This caused my parents to take me to a psychiatrist when I was 10, where I was put on various antipsychotics which honestly made my life hell. Those meds didn't work for me at all, I became even more hostile to everyone around me as a result, so the psychiatrist took that as ""see! She DOES need those pills!"" Instead of listening when I told her I did not want to be on those pills because of the effects. Oh well. After 14 years of ""playing good little lunatic"" (as I personally call it while referring to my own situation only) I'm now on lithium only, after my mom had her 3rd near death experience not too long ago - and I'm coping. Even on a regular Tuesday while on antipsychotics, I wasn't coping and occasionally bedridden. I regularly think of the psychiatrist who told me I'd never be able to live a life outside of a facility without AP meds, she was definitely wrong and her treatment plan for me robbed me of years of my life (heavily overmedicated with debilitating side effects, quality of life was below zero tbh) and at the same time, her incompetence also had its part in my development to be the person I am today. I fucking love that person, flaws and all. 
For child me, it would've definitely been a much more healthy experience if she was just given the time and space to talk about what she felt in a safe way. However, with how everything turned out now, maybe all the hurt was useful after all",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1invnll/just_a_little_rant_really/,ataraxisch,1739379555.0,mentalillness

2077,How to get over parasocial relationships?,"So recently I read a post about parasocial relationships in this sub and it again triggered a guilt feeling about what has happened in the last 2 years(like 7-8 years in overall). So here it goes--

There was a girl I fell interested in. But due to some rumours being spread around in my college about me, I had decided to not talk to any girl. I know it's seems like a loser mentality but that's how it was. 

So I took 2 months to talk to her for the first time. I was observing her behavior to know if she was safe to talk(i know its called stalking). Having being through lot of manipulation and having heard 1000s of lies, I thought I could test her character with every talk. So I tried. Obviously ended up getting rejected due to something I didn't do. Many of u can predict why 

People say I idealize her and so. But I know her flaws and I don't defend her. So she basically shared a lot of similar flaws, hence got attached deeply to her. But that's not the main problem.

As I got emotionally attached, I developed the imaginary situation of being with her. I made her my gf in my day dreaming schedule.
Hence the term. Do u think it is parasocial? If yes, please tell me the solution.


1. I don't have any insta/ Facebook or any social media platform.
2. I don't have any of her photos
3. I don't see her often.
4. I don't talk to her friends. We have 0 friends in common.

So the solutions online don't work for me. What should I do?

Also my friend told that I have ADHD and I can't tell my parents about it. I am a boy and so my parents will throw the matter out if I ask them for mental health checkup.

It started off during the summer when I went back to a job that I used to work at but some shit happened and I had a good bit of trauma from it. I went back to work there and it felt really different and I felt like I was constantly stressed or pissed. Eventually after a few weeks of working there there was this instant that I still remember to this day where all of a sudden it felt like I was ripped out of my consciousness and was watching myself moving around and stuff but wasn't actually in control. I immediately freaked tf out as I had never experienced anything like that. I am 18 years old and was 18 at that time. I used to be on Concerta for ADHD but I had stopped months ago and had no negative side effects. I smoked weed but I didn't drink or do any nicotine products. The feeling is still persistent over half a year later and I just don't know what to do. My doctor recommended I go back on the ADHD medicine but I tried to and I hated how it made me feel as it only seemed to make it worse. I don't smoke weed anymore but I do drink and use nicotine every once and a while. The feeling is more toned down. It could be brain fog but its so persistent, its lasted so long, and it hasn't ever eased stopped even for a moment. I'm currently in college and I am stressed but it is nowhere near as sever as it was when I was working that job. I'm starting to run out of any hope that I will ever get better.

And after 5 years of being together I don't know where my relationship is going anymore with my boyfriend. We met in a very vulnerable period of both of our lives and I suspect we trauma bonded. I don't know what's happening with me anymore It doesn't feel like me..its like there's something rotting inside of me. Just something dark bad and nasty. I don't want to feel like I hate others happiness but I can't help but feel dejected. Because it's like even though I empathized with them in their pain they just feel I'm overreacting and not being rational when I'm going through something. My mother doesn't even like me but she has to control everything so prevents any chance of me moving out. My boyfriend is only with me because I think he feels like he won't get anyone right now and he needs support kind of atleast for now.. he doesn't even like me like every time I ask him why the hell he is with me he just says ""you're cute"". And I am so pathetic and lonely and also because I struggle to write people off I'm still with him because he was my best friend and I promised he will always have me. I genuinely don't want to live anymore. I don't like myself. I don't see any chances of things getting better for me..I overthink and give myself anxiety about every possible thing. I don't feel normal. I'm thinking about ways to end it almost every day but can't really come up with anything discreet as if I commit at my mom's place..the place will become haunted and dirty for her and she spent a lot to buy it..I dread gatherings with people I know because they always comment on how miserable I'm. But there's a wedding coming up in the family and I am scared as fuck because I would have to put myself out there..realizing my boyfriend is like my parents too..selfish , self centered , aloof , doesn't like me it's all just messing me up more.

2091,This is a nightmare,I’m an autistic person that was diagnosed with magical thinking ocd generalized anxiety disorder and depression. For the past month it’s been Dante’s inferno for me. ocd has been giving me one fear after the next I’m getting fucked over up down left right sideways under. My ocd is freaking out about if nick Wilde was a school teacher or employee at one point and I had no clue so I have to search that up but I’m having trouble with that because whenever I try to read anything ocd says I didn’t read it right so I have to re read. I’ll give you some context of my fears with school related things The reason why I am so paranoid about school related stuff is because I was bullied severely in both elementary school and middle school by both students and teachers. i write scripts for film ideas and show ideas and im planning to film them and post them in YouTube one in particular is a film series and show featuring my 5 most favorite Disney characters Robin Hood brer fox nick Wilde honest John and Foxy Loxy and in the films and show they get into all kinds of crazy comedical situations and it would be in the style of a Wes Anderson film and look like a late 90s early 2000s film but here’s the thing Don’t like school at all so I sworn to not feature anything school related in any of my ideas. But my ocd always fears that whenever I comment anything online or tell someone in person about my ideas I have said that there will be something school related in it or that it would be similar to a film or show that’s school related if I break that rule ocd gives me it will make all of my ideas off limits then I cannot do any of them. And I’m also currently trying to reset my mind but I can’t because ocd tells me I didn’t do it right and I’m also trying to make a list of rules for my ocd so ocd won’t f me over but I need to wait a certain number of minutes in order to make an updated version once I delete an old version to make way for a new version and if I don’t the update will not work I’m also stressing about if SpongeBob is a show about school because a I shared my film and show ideas to r/furry and I mentioned that the show would be similar to SpongeBob with odd and creepy or just batshit crazy scenes but my ocd started freaking out because it believes that it’s a show about school so I’m trying to search up if it is or not and I’m having the same issue as the nick Wilde situation I am in. I feel like there’s never going to be a closure of this nightmare I know this may seem stupid to most of you and this is probably funny but to me it’s an absolute nightmare I’ve tried talking to my therapist and psychologist about it since November but I just get bullshit responses I’m also on Prozac but honestly it hasn’t been working lately maybe it’s because I don’t take it on the time I have to idk I’m a mental case it seems.

2092,Sutter Health - how should I get started with mental illness care?,"I know the title says ""I"" but this post is really for my fiance.

He suffers from serious mental illness and was never properly diagnosed or cared for by Kaiser Permanente. He recently changed over to Sutter Health in the hopes of getting better care.

Currently, he's in a severe depression and anxious state and needs care. But, he doesn't know where to get started with Sutter and that has him feeling disinterested in getting things setup - ""what's the point when there's no hope"". He is completely off his meds and feels he was misdiagnosed and incorrectly medicated since it all began (middle school, 20 years ago).

In his current state, what is the quickest and easiest to follow process with getting mental illness services set in motion with Sutter? He needs a team and an holistic approach rather than being prescribed medication he's already tried without proper and thorough testing.

If there are a lot of hoops to jump through and bouncing around, or even if it's not straight forward enough, he will lose interest and will not get the care he so desperately needs!

2095,Partner using my injury as an excuse to avoid his mental illness,"My fiance, who I've been with for over 7 years, suffers from severe mental illness that has never appropriately been addressed and treated. Over the years, it has become significantly worse, especially when he got off all of his medication and coping tools (including marijuana use, which was a huge benefit to slowing down his mind that normally goes a million miles a second). As this has progressively gotten worse, so has his motivation to do anything about it. He has convinced himself that he is hopeless and there isn't anything anyone can do to help him.

At the start of this severe progression, almost 2.5 years ago, I suffered a spinal cord injury that had me in the hospital for 8 days and unable to walk for over a month. I was going through an immense amount of pain and despite him being by my side and supporting me, he still suffered his own trauma seeing me going through it all. It also didn't help that being paralyzed in the hospital is extremely unflattering when you're plus size (I was 260 then). 

Since my injury, he seems to use my injury as an excuse for addressing his own issues. Despite me being 95% healed and able to function on my own, also being 30 lbs down since then, he still suffers deep depressive states and tells me ""he can't get the image of me in the hospital out of his head"". Whenever we try to address his problems, they always come back to being directed towards me. He will not admit he has a serious mental issue and uses my past injury and my current weight as a distraction. I'm convinced that no matter how much I lose weight, he will continue to find issues with me just to ignore facing the true source of the issues.

What should I do? I can I make it to where I am no longer the scapegoat? How can I help him realize the serious importance that he recognize the underlying issue?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1inctez/partner_using_my_injury_as_an_excuse_to_avoid_his/,More_to_Liebe,1739316601.0,mentalillness
2096,Advice/Diagnoses needed on sister.,"My sister is 46 years old and lives with my dad. She has been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety for years. She has recently been told that she is on the spectrum. My dad and are having the hardest time dealing with her. She’s either super up or super down. 

She is the messiest person. Her car will be filled with trash all the way to the window, her room is filled with trash and clothes. She will spill things and just leave it there. I once spent 8 hours cleaning her house with over 30 bags of trash. 

She will buy things, like brand new shoes and they get trashed in the car and she’ll never wear them again then buy more shoes. She will run out of money bc she is wasteful and just buy things, then take out loans and never pays them. Then her car will get impounded and my dad will have to pay for it.

She abuses her adderall medicine. My dad tries to help her with it but she’ll go pick up the prescription and take some out so she can take them all at once. 

She will start something like losing weight, buys all the food for it and never does it. This has happened with multiple things and I think a lot of it has to do with abusing the speed medicine. 
She is super manipulative.

I know it doesn’t seem bad but we’re really struggling with her impulses and behaviors. Any advice on what to do or some kind of diagnoses??

2097,Invasive thoughts of being harmed,"Hey, so there's quite a bit wrong with me for a while. Among other things, severe social anxiety, depression, and a couple of attempts in the past. I dont even know how much of that is true anymore, or if im somewhow subconcouisly malingering. I've been through multiple therapists, psychiatrists, medication, hospitals, each giving me conflicting information as to what is happening to me. And while I've been putting up a front that things are getting better, everything is spiralling out of control in reality.

But this one weird thing has been haunting me for years now and I don't really know how to explain it.

Basically, on multiple occasions I imagine (fantasize even) getting beaten up my multiple people with blunt objects (sometimes bats, sometimes metal pipes, etc) to the point where every bone in my body is broken, I find it hard to breathe (in reality as well) and then am left for dead...

I don't know why this keeps happening, or why I seem to *want* it to happen most of the time. It changes sometimes; most of the times the people aren't important, but on some occasions they are people I know: friends, family, classmates, etc. Sometimes I'm bound to a chair as this happens. Sometimes its knives.

I don't know why this along with everything else is happennjng to me. My parents are loving even if they fight a bit, I don't really have any experience with people bullying me too heavily. I didn't have any friends at school, but neither did I have any enemies. And everyone tells me that the position I currently am in college is great. But nothing feels that way...

I don't even know why I am posting this. Do I want an explanation? Am I doing just for attention? Am I just wallowing in self pity? I feel I can't tell anyone about this and its only getting worse... I don't really have a cohesive thought while writing this, so I'm sorry for being weird and all over the place.

2102,Will these combined factors get me hospitalized if I'm honest with my therapist or psychiatrist?,"So, I'm schizoaffective and to at least some degree currently in psychosis, others think more if I verbalize my thoughts but I'm acting normally I think. Not manic, and I don't think I'm depressed? But unsure, maybe mildly just some of the time. But when I get depressed it's usually dialed up to 11 pretty much immediately, so it's hard for me to tell. 2 weeks ago I had a psychiatry appointment because I was obsessing over traveling between dimensions and not being able to find my native one whenever I die here. But I had an experience where the entities showed me various realities including my native one, so even though I don't trust them I know at least they could potentially guide me. Both of my antipsychotics were increased- vraylar to the max and invega to the second-to-max. She wanted me to come back in 2 to 3 weeks from then, and I made an appointment for the soonest I could, which is next tuesday. I wanted it sooner because while I am less preoccupied with the matter of realities, I only felt right for the initial few days on the new doses. About a week in, I started getting paranoid and irritable in public again (not as bad as before but enough to concern and bother me) and one night had a 2.5 hour episode of distorted sounds leading me to suspect my partner was feigning a nap to avoid interacting with me (long story short I was just obsessively paranoid the whole time).

Separately, I used to have a bad cutting addiction, still cut occasionally, and since the paranoia came back I have started again, don't know why the timing. So it's only been about a week, but it's most days and I keep wanting to again whenever the lingering pain goes away. It's just about wanting the pain. But I am depth seeking (but still avoiding needing stitches, so I can hide them from my partner, and to my knowledge it's not in a particularly dangerous spot), and I don't want to indefinitely continue but I do want to continue until I run out of room in the designated spaces.

I'm basically on the max for mood shit and nearly on the max for antipsychotics. I worry that 1) my psychiatrist will want to have me in the hospital for supervised quicker med changes/adjustments, and 2) that anyone I see (therapist, psychiatrist, or case manager) will see my intent to continue cutting and depth seeking as me being a danger to myself. I also worry about these things being taken in conjunction. I see both my case manager and therapist on this friday, and don't have my psychiatry appointment until tuesday.

Yes, I know. Low self-esteem. Well, I don't know any other way. And when I do make strides, I end up failing and feel like a fake and my ""good self-esteem"" was just a fake. 

It all stemmed from Senior yr of high school. This really good looking girl was into me and I couldn't believe it. I thought she was just teasing me. I didn't really like her anyway cuz she smoked pot and did other drugs. And I was a good Christian, squeaky clean boy who had an innocence look to me. I think that's why she was interested in me. She went to a different high school. I met her at a pizza place I worked at. 

Prom was coming up and I had no intention on going. I didn't have a group of friends to go with cuz they didn't wanna go to prom. They weren't very social either. And she told me she'd go to prom with me.

I snapped at her. She didn't know anything about me or how much of a social misfit I am. I flat out and told her, I don't have a group of friends to go with. I'll just bore you to death. She didn't believe me. 

We went out one day and it went exactly how I thought it would. I froze up and it was an awkward silence the whole time. I dropped her off at home and she practically jumped out of my car and ran inside. I was still a virgin at the time and I was nervous around girls so I didn't make a move. Or when I did, it felt flat and awkward.

Next thing I know it, everybody is calling me ""gay"" at work. I was so embarrassed.

Is this important enough of an event to bring up with your psychiatrist/therapist or am I overreacting.

Important note: I acknowledge that it is within their marital right to perform these activities, but we shared the same room for many of my formative years and so I was often exposed to these activities.

It also doesn't help that I was downright terrified of my parents knowing I was awake because they tended to get heavy-handed when I was younger and were very strict about sleep.

For example, she might hear someone say something innocuous (a joke, a passing remark etc.) and later say that person is weird or worse. Sometimes she interprets said remarks as offensive, rude or mean. There is no way to convince her or persuade her.

**2. She will suddenly and quickly get angry during normal conversations.**

Usually, this happens if someone corrects her or doesn't agree with her completely. It can be something as small as saying ""I don't think X meant it that way."" or ""I don't remember X saying that."" She will usually angrily shout and say something like ""YES, X DID SAY THAT!"" It's almost as if someone cursed at her or slapped her mid-conversation, that's how quickly she can go from regular talking to shouting.

**3. She is very busy and talkative.** She talks so much and so relentlessly that this has caused fights before.

Even if the other person wants to step away or stop the conversation, she will often follow that person and keep talking. The subject might vary, but she often repeats herself as well. She always seems to want to get something off her chest rather than have any back-and-forth with someone. Sometimes I think she might as well be talking to a wall.  However, she does also get angry if someone clearly doesn't listen to her. OR if someone does listen to her and engages, but not in the precise way that she wants. For example, if you emphathize with her, she might contradict you and say something like ""No, it wasn't a big deal!"" Even if what she's said so far makes it sound like a big deal, she'll often contradict the other person.

**4. She'll often ask inappropriate questions, especially about money.**

She'll ask for prices of everything, including the jeans someone is wearing, their rent, etc. There seems to be a line here where she understands that sometimes it's not okay to discuss money. But she'll make a point to always bring it up. For example, instead of asking ""How much was that dress?"" she might say, ""There's no point asking me about the price, right?""

She is very sensitive to money and wants to avoid costs at all times. She'll loudly proclaim something is expensive (at stores, etc.) or demand discounts.

**5. Judy will berate and belittle someone in public if she's in a mood.**

She won't say what's bothering her and her mood is usually unpredictable. But she will go on a rant about another family member's appearance, for example. This can range from anything from body size, body parts, clothes, etc. so it can be incredibly humiliating for the target of her rants. She will continue this type of rant non-stop for sometimes over an hour or two. Then, she'll suddenly stop and become completely happy and laid-back. Sometimes, I've wondered if this is her version of being hangry, because I distinctly remember that this happened once when she took a sip of milkshake after a lengthy non-stop public rant.

**6.  She can feel like she's being personally attacked at any moment.**

If you make plans to meet her at 1 pm and you call her at 12:55 to see where she's at, she'll get snappy and say, ""What? We agreed to meet at 1pm, so why are you calling me?!""

**7. She often exaggerates or lies.**

Judy is a very funny person and enjoys telling stories. Part of the reason her stories are so funny because she embellishes and re-enacts conversation in exaggerated ways. However, she also exaggerates even simple facts. She'll tell people, for example, that her light bill is 1000 dollars even if it's 300 dollars.

I'm not sure if she truly believes these things, but sometimes she outright lies. She once sent a relative a mean text and later denied sending it even when others pointed out the records in her phone.

Perhaps she forgets or tells herself these things never happened, but she also seems to know what she's done. For example, she acted very apologetic to the relative she sent the mean text to, even though she never admitted sending the text or even saying ""I'm sorry"" to said relative. I feel like if she wanted to, she could've just pretended nothing had ever happened.

**8. She can control her behavior in certain circumstances.**

In some situations, she can control her behavior and speak very little. For example, when she's meeting people who have the power to take away something she wants, she'll sit quietly and not talk a lot. This doesn't happen too often, though, so I don't know how this works. Maybe she just gets extremely nervous and doesn't want to talk, and it's not so much about being calculated and conniving?

That's all I can think about for now. Obviously, no one can diagnose anyone based on an online post, but any advice or insight on Judy would be very much appreciated.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1imnvtk/is_my_family_member_mentally_ill/,softboiledegger,1739240454.0,mentalillness

2112,i learned to never lie about having mental illnesses that you dont have and i cant live with it.,"i (19F) lied to my bf (19M) about having DID in the very beginning of our relationship. He brought it up and i thought acting like i had the disorder would make him love me more and never get bored of me or want another girl. we've been dating for 776 days .

ive always had issues with lying for attention especially for my parents to react , because my older sister has mild to severe autism and requires a lot of care. I had to take care of my sister and never really had an older sis.

ive faked stomach issues, gave myself bruises and scratches so my mom would notice , give myself welts by pinching my skin and other things . i was so desperate for attention.

my parents didnt do anything every time the guilt ate me alive and i would go crying to them to tell them the truth . they just told me dont do it again >:( !! and i swear i never would . but every time i felt a little overshadowed or brushed over , suddenly i have a hand problem that makes my wrist hurt when i bend it.

i told my boyfriend last night after sobbing for hours and hours about it . this last week it was so horrible and the guilty thoughts were killing me. 

when i told him he asked me a lot of questions proving just how fake everything was, and i started to realize how horrible and evil of a person i am.

i just wanted him to love me and never leave me . but now he might not want to date me at all.

ive been crying all day because of how badly he's hurting . hes a shell of himself and ive never seen this side of him before . im a monster and i think im actually going to hurt myself . he was the only guy who ever loved me truly and expected nothing else but communication and honest from me.

im bad at both.

im so close to relapsing on sh and i cant take this anymore . i cant ever forgive myself for what i did to him and our relationship will never be the same . i wish i never said anything and i hope when i go driving tonight i die.",0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1imk6uc/i_learned_to_never_lie_about_having_mental/,Ok_Advantage8220,1739229388.0,mentalillness
2113,Asking for a diagnosis?,"Sorry in advance for the long post! TW; brief mention of su!c!de, sh



Ok so a bit of context - I've already been to therapy once, I didn't really like the woman so I just stopped showing up and eventually she took me off her schedule, and now I'm at school in a different country so I don't have to see her any more.

My mom forced me to see that therapist, and I didn't wan tot be there so I wasn't honest with her and was just trying to get out of it without spilling any of my life secrets lol.

That said, now, a year later, I've realized that maybe both my mom and that therapist where on to something and there's something seriously wrong with me (for context, I think I have anxiety/maybe ADHD, I'm pretty suicidal and I sh a lot).

I want to reach out to my schools nurse about getting a diagnosis/seeing a professional/potentially getting medication? My school has a full health center, since we're a boarding school, so I know they have somebody I can see and talk to about this.

Basically, I'm a bit too socially awkward for this and I'm worried if I bring up wanting to take medication they'll think that I'm doing all of this just because I want drugs.

So is there any way somebody could give me like a literal script of what to say? Both to like the receptionist about setting up an appointment and to the actual therapist lady? I think I'll do okay once the lady actually starts asking me questions but idk how to facilitate that and stuff. Tysm :)

2114,dating and making friends being schizo-effective sucks & i want to give up trying.,"at little bit of context about myself before i jump into my ramble, i dated and married my high-school sweetheart, then we got divorced. i was diagnosed after my first child was born. now, i am trying to date again and step outside of my comfort zone in order to meet new friends or associates. all of this is new to me, as i have never had to date or change. here’s the thing, i have a hard time with attachment, expressing my own emotions (i mimic others emotions.) or making someone my favorite person by default, it can a be friend or otherwise. almost always the person that i like or enjoy goes on a pedestal and once they mess up, i go into a funk/episode and have to get the courage to start all over again. it’s like a blow back to back, and i want to give up. but i am so fucking tired of being alone and suffering in silence. 

the main reason why i am venting is because, i talked to someone. enjoyed their company and then out of nowhere, they blocked me. nothing was said, we had a lot in common and then ..radio silence. now, i am left wondering what the hell did i do ? what did i say ? instead of maybe that person just isn’t that into me. 

i am very clear on my emotions and self-aware of my actions but it doesn’t change the outcome of my feelings or the anger that sits there on my chest. it just makes me justify that maybe i am better off being alone. even though i don’t like it, maybe it’s just better. i’m used to it. anyway. my apologies if this is long. thank you for reading.

2115,Is he really mentally ill or just a bad person?,"
I want to understand what’s happening to this person who grew up in a rather ordinary household, no history of abuse by family but I think he got bullied in the past by his classmate. He is extremely verbally abusive, especially towards family members, and lacks any sense of shame or self-awareness. He has no respect for his family members but controls his tone of voice with strangers. If he faces some disagreement with strangers, he will direct this frustration on his family. He lashes out over the smallest mistakes, demeans everyone, demands that everything go his way, and expects absolute agreement from family. If challenged, he resorts to shouting, verbal abuse, and sometimes physical aggression, like breaking objects. He gets jealous when others succeed and even scolds his parents at any sign of affection towards his siblings. He has no friends and is incapable of considering anything beyond his own desires. Conversations with him are impossible—if you disagree, he fixates on it and keeps bringing it up. Even if you try to reason with him, he pretends to listen but then circles back to the same argument as if nothing was said. So you can't have a normal conversation with him. He is also paranoid, refusing to open windows or curtains, and has OCD. This doesn't mean he isn't functional in life, he is functional with his basic care. To the outside world, he ""looks"" seemingly normal but they cannot be more wrong. Surprisingly, he has a wife, whom he expects to obey him completely and never speak back. He sometimes physically abuses her and verbally abuses her everyday on every small slip ups. Relatives and family have run out of advice for him, as nothing helps or changes his behavior. He refuses to listen to reason.

2118,Need advice - Mom suffering paranoia,"My mom (62) suffers from paranoia.

Like many people in similar situations, she doesn't believe she's ill. This has been an issue for most of my life, but it has worsened since my dad left eight years ago - it is a miracle he lasted so long. She's lived alone ever since, rarely leaving the house and afraid to drive anywhere by herself. Since losing her business, she hasn't worked and is now out of money.

She's convinced that her business was ruined by her relatives. She believes her phone, computer, and email are constantly being hacked, and that people follow her, taking pictures and videos, when she's outside.

We've tried several times to intervene, attempting to show her the flaws in her reasoning. However, she perceives these attempts as personal attacks and threatens to cut off all contact with me and my brother if we bring it up again.

She has been diagnosed with paranoia multiple times in the past and even started medication, but the side effects were significant. Because she doesn't believe she's ill, she stopped taking the medication after a while, seeing no point in treating a condition she doesn't think she has.

Does anyone have experience successfully helping someone with paranoia? How can we help her recognize the inaccuracies in her perceptions?",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1im26gl/need_advice_mom_suffering_paranoia/,sponghle,1739179335.0,mentalillness

2120,developed an urge to hurt small animals into my pre-teen years and its getting worse,"im a 17 year old girl, and when i was really young, i loved every animal with all my heart. i wanted to be a vet and when id stay at my gmas house, there used to be a lot of little frogs that would run around. i used to chase them around and play with them, but now if i saw a frog, i would probably try to catch and dissect it. 



i still love animals, i just have a weird urge to hurt small animals that has started since i was around 9-11. thinking of hurting a fully grown cat or dog or even wild animals makes me really sad and i hate animal abusers with a passion. but i think about hurting tiny animals and taping them down from their limbs. mainly frogs, birds and hamsters. typing this, i feel guilty and gross feeling like this but i dont feel guilty doing it.

  
i dont do it much but im starting to get more and more dreams about killing small animals or even people (though i would never get to that point irl)



i didnt have any traumatic experience that would link to this at least from what i can think of, ive never had anyone abuse me in anyway. it literally just started coming out of nowhere. now i do have some pretty bad anger issues and tend to need to use physical force to get it all out, and thats what i maybe thought caused these feelings. but the thought could just come out of nowhere sometimes, and i think of doing these actions as a fun little time passer",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1imcv40/developed_an_urge_to_hurt_small_animals_into_my/,baylxz,1739211431.0,mentalillness

2127,how to explain what I’m feeling/thinking to my psychiatrist?," I (18F) have had intrusive(?) thoughts as far back as I can remember. When I was younger it was that I wanted to hurt the people I loved or that I had accidentally killed someone.

as I grew up my thoughts became more disturbing, and started going directly against my moral compass. 

for example, I used to babysit, and whenever I’d go to their house my brain would tell me I was only babysitting them cause I’m attracted to them. I can’t call babies or kids cute without thinking “what if you’re secretly a pedophile?”.

I also have had racist thoughts, I’ll be with my friends as my friend group is very diverse, and I will suddenly think the most horrible things about these people I care about.

part of me questions if these thoughts are truly intrusive or if I’m just a monster. 

I feel like they’re intrusive cause as soon as I have them I immediately hate myself for having them and question why I thought it in the first place, I also *know* I’m not a pedophile/racist/someone who wants to hurt people. but what if I secretly am and just don’t know it?

and more importantly what do I say to my psychiatrist? I can’t tell her I sometimes have pedophilic/racist intrusive thoughts, can I?

I have to admit, I did blow up a bit today when I tried to tell my mom how I feel. I didn't say things in the nicest tone but I was just so tired of keeping it all inside. I called my parents out today for not getting me help even though they know I've been struggling for quite some time now but I never meant for it to be manipulative.

I don't really remember what it was like before I started struggling. It causes me to feel like the lack of energy and the inability to get out of bed is normal – because that's what I've been living like for the past 5 years.

They tried to get me help after a really bad episode when I just couldn't get out of bed, but didn't want to spend money on an actual good therapist. I got to go to one for free, once a month but it didn't really help. After around two or three months of going to those ""therapy sessions"", it was already the end of the school year and they decided it isn't worth it to go there anymore next year.

They blame my phone for my bad mental health and often punish me by taking it away when I'm unable to go to school because of how I feel. It's frustrating and it leaves me no real escape to just clear my mind.

I know they don't mean any harm and probably just don't know what to do to help me, but it just makes me feel so worthless. Like I'm not sick enough to get me help. It's gotten to a point that I don't even want to talk to them about this stuff anymore because they just don't even do anything about it – like that time my mom found out about my self harm and just told me not to do it again.

Let me just jump straight in and say I have always felt something was off about me. Throughout my life, I have had trouble making friends, was bullied a lot in school. Always find it difficult to strike conversations, have limited attention span. I drift off from conversations, find most people non-exciting, get bored easily, have an addictive personality.... cigarettes, tv, porn. I have always been rebuked by my parents for my nature and lack of manners. I have had very few friends throughout my life and have fallen out with most of them. I have been very high functional though and apart from certain points in life where I dealt with extreme self hate regarding ""what tf is wrong with me"" or ""how could i forget/overlook this"", I have dealt with my extreme levels of procastination rather well. Now I am 33 years old with a job and a wife. I hate my job. Am just somehow holding on. A thorough review of my performance ought to rightfully get me fired.

I am very heavy on procastination. I will put off 5 min tasks for hours. Now for instance, I have a meeting in an hour and half following up on a small task I was supposed to get done on Friday, but I haven't even started on it coz I just had to post this and get some opinions. I should mostly be good though and am confident, I will either get it done or successfully stall the stakeholder with some qns and clarifications and then try to get it done by EOD today.

Today morning while taking a drive with my parents and uncle... my dad said that in junior school I was labelled as a SLOW LEARNER by my primary school teacher. Dad never got me a diagnosis but inferred that it was a good thing and reflected that I was logical and refused to just learn or memorise things unless it made logical and reasonable sense to me. I was always good in mathematics but was dreadful when it came to most other subjects. 

I have spent my whole life kicking myself for coming up short. Disappointed almost every woman I have dated, lost almost every friend I have made. Have always had a short attention span. While I pass off as neurotypical, I feel am deeply flawed but have always thought of myself as lazy.

Rn, am just feeling a deep sense of resentment towards my parnts for not bothering to even get me a diagnosis. But, on the other hand if there indeed is something off about my noggin, that would explain so much about my life and maybe I could look to get help even. Feeling very confused about this rn. 

And I dunno how to proceed. How can I get a diagnosis? What kinda dr to go to? Are there online tests? Are they accurate? 

Please advise. And sorry about the word salad. ",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1im0dbc/something_might_be_wrong_with_me/,Over_Effective4291,1739171118.0,mentalillness
2133,Weed and psychotic hallucinations,"I just witnessed my step dad do the weirdest thing after taking one hit of weed. Some background information is that he’s been smoking weed regularly almost everyday for the past 6(?)  years. Sometimes he acts a little weird but I just figure he smoked too much or took a tolerance break. I’ve smoked with him hundreds of times before and he’s always been fine. So last night he broke my bong, he told me he was falling asleep and fell over and knocked the table it was sitting on. He said he would buy me a new one so I go and find one I like and bring it home. We get to talking and he confesses that he took mushroom chocolate the night before and got a little too high and knocked it over. He continues to tell me about how amazing the trip was and it felt like he saw the different pieces of life that were all separated into different slivers of a pie. He says the light was shining on everything outside and then the objects would disappear but the light stayed. He also says the earth was moving sideways and that's why he started to fall. I started to get a little annoyed because he got so high he accidentally fell over and broke my bong. But I think whatever he said he'll pay for my new one and we go outside to smoke and celebrate. We're talking like normal as I load up my bowl and I look over and he’s taken one hit and starts fumbling over his words. I think he’s coughing while trying to finish his sentence and just can’t quite get the words out. Then he starts to lean over and I think oh he must have taken too big of a hit and his chest hurts. I stare at him for about 20 seconds before realizing he's not even coughing and is just kinda hunched over. I ask him if he’s ok and he looks up at me and just starts hysterically laughing at me. I ask him again if he’s okay and he says ya and immediately slumps back over. He looks like how people on fentanyl do. He drops the pipe in his hand and then tries to lean forward to pick it up but he can't. I know now something is really wrong. I don’t say anything and just watch him as he slumps over, leans forward, looks around the world and then slumps back down again while having moments of silence and hysterical laughter. He starts grabbing the table and almost knocks over my brand new bong. He leans back up, starts looking at me and tries to say something. He can't get out full sentences but keeps repeating, “I'm so glad I'm sitting down because I keep feeling and the earth is moving sideways. Then says he feels like he's falling backwards and starts jolting in his chair, as if he were literally falling backwards. He repeats this about 10 times before I tell him I'll be right back and I run inside to call my mom. I tell her that Joel is having some weird psychotic break and she needs to come home right away. I go back outside and he looks as if he's in a different dimension and he’s having flashbacks from his mushroom high from the night before. I stay with him and now he’s starting to actually form sentences and sit upright. He says he thought he fell over in front of me and was so embarrassed. This whole time he doesn’t seem to be anxious but actually having the absolute best high ever, like he’s on heroin or something. He's just smiling and I keep reassuring him he's not falling and I try to act as normal as possible to not scare him. My mom comes home about 5 minutes later and I push her inside to tell her what happened about 2 minutes later Joel walks inside. I'm amazed he can stand, he looks blasted but my mom is used to him having bloodshot eyes. He says hi honey and acts like nothing ever happened. He is acting a little weird, but as if he’s just too high. He doesn’t talk much at first but as time goes on he starts to sober up and act normal. About 15 minutes after my mom gets home he's almost completely back to normal like he just snapped out of it. I start thinking that I'm the crazy one and that didn’t just happen. I also smoked the same weed he did the night before and I was totally fine. It was definitely not laced. I have a feeling he had some flashback to the night before when he smoked or that he was having some kind of psychotic hallucinations from the weed that was set off from the mushrooms. I have no idea what happened and am still processing this. Anyone know what it could be?

2134,I think I need help,"A couple months ago I had a skin tag, just a skin tag. I removed it myself, there was blood and obviously it was a messy job. After that I started obsessing about what else I could do to my body. Whenever I'm alone or feel unstable I can't stop thinking about what I could remove,cut off or just do to my body and it doesn't go away. I'm so drawn to it but I know it's harmful and I know these thoughts are not good. It's almost like I want to do procedures to myself, but nothing as far as amputation. Just fix little imperfections with at home surgery and/ or to see what's really under my skin. Is there any way I could stop this? Or at least understand what this is?

2136,One major side effect of my medication that I will live with forever,"I (18F) have talked to my therapist, my psychiatrist, my doctor, and my gynaecologist, and they all say the same thing. “Well it’s your mental health that’s the priority here, and you need this medication so there’s nothing you can do really.”

I have bipolar disorder, an my medication severely effects my libido. When I say severely, I mean I don’t get turned on. AT ALL.  This started when I 13 and I was out on anti depressants. I haven’t been able to get “turned on” since. And before, I had a pretty high libido, but I was only 13 before I had that taken away and I hadn’t had the chance to have any adult experience yet, if I’m being honest, I didn’t even know how to take care of myself in that way.

You might think that it’s not a big deal but it changes everything in relationships and sex. And it’s like, even tho it’s a distant memory now, I knew what it felt like, and I want to be able to experience that again, and I most likely never will. 

I’m really hoping I’m not sounding like a massive pervert here, and I know sex and stuff isn’t everything but it is a big part of life. It’s a big piece of a pie chart that is different for me than it is for you. 

Last time I vented about this everyone in the comments was like “omg chill just get your meds changed”, that’s the thing though, I spoke to my doctor and he said there was no changing my meds and that there was absolutely nothing anybody could do to change this. Unless I went off my meds which I have been obviously instructed not to do.

Well I’m here, my meds have changed some other things. I’ve gained a lot of weight bc of them and I have really bad acne now. My mom always says “it’s better you plump and and mentality stable then skinny and in the mental hospital”.

Me… I would pick skinny and insane icl, I HATE HATE HATE the way I look now. Yes, I have tired diets, exercise, skin creams, face washes, silk sheets l. Nothing is working.

2137,I have a paraphilic disorder,"Before you say anything I'm not a troll nor I'm trying to groom someone. I just need to get some advice on how to get help.

I'm a 17 years old female and for the last two months I've been having these fantasies and urges, I guess, on children. Before they used to give me a lot of anxiety but now I think I like them. I think I felt anxious because I was scared of what others might think. I've already looked into OCD but it doesn't feel like it. I've been to a therapist but I stopped going because I couldn't bring myself to be 100% honest. I mean I told her about these thoughts and she told me it probably was OCD but I didn't buy that. I say it's not OCD because I'm not scared of being a pedophile because I have some thoughts and urges that prove otherwise and looking back I should've recognised some signals. Sometimes I thought of acting on those thoughts just to be put in prison and be locked out of society because that would be the best thing for me. I think I've never acted on them but sometimes my mind screams that I should just let myself go, even though I know it's wrong. Right now I still want to see a therapist and a good psychiatrist to understand what's going on and to see if it's hormones or other stuff but I don't know what to search. I'm scared that when I'll say to them that I wanted to act at some point they'll report me. I want to be helped. Sometimes I feel like I don't want to be like this and sometimes I feel like I'm okay with this. I let my social life die because I don't want people to be friends with such a disgusting person. It's unfair to them. Also I feel like I'm always lying to others because the don't truly know me. Everytime I try to enjoy something I feel like I don't deserve it because I'm a disgusting person. I feel bad for my parents because they now have to live with this faulty piece. I've had a normal childhood. My mind is broken. I'd really for it to be ""just"" OCD but I know it isn't. OCD is curable, pedophilia not. If there was a pill to stop these thoughts I'd take it but I'm not sure because if it was OCD I'll start living again but if it was pedophilia I would feel distressed because for the longest time I thought I was asexual. I've never had these things before. 

It deeply pains me to accept this part of me and I think I'll never do because it feels wrong to me to do so. I also spoke to another pedophile and he told he started out just like me so that's why I'm so convinced. I'll gladly take every kind of advice because I'm really desperate.",7,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ildq4s/i_have_a_paraphilic_disorder/,just_v3nting,1739104313.0,mentalillness

2139,My story,"I (M26) have been very shy since childhood. My parents or sibling were not, and that's probably why they never understood the struggle or could have thought of it to be an actual problem. It is because people consider a shy kid as simply cute and don't mind the behaviour, unlike in the case of an adult, where he or she is expected to be outgoing as if it's a necessity to get through life. And people actually expect that a shy kid would automatically become an outgoing adult. During school, I did not have many friends, and those I had were not close, and so I ended up losing them over the years. My life was limited to my bedroom and classroom, not because I was forced to but because I just happened to be that way. In fact, I even had an emotional boundary with my family. This led to me behaving in ways that did not match with what people around me expected out of an adolescent. They tried to change it but couldn't, probably because they could not understand the actual problem. As I moved towards adulthood, I was suddenly exposed to the world beyond my bedroom or classroom. It was too much for the naive me. I just couldn't cope with the world and, as a social creature, meet the expectations of those around me. As a teenager, I had my parents as a shield, but now as an adult, I was expected to change myself and get through the world myself. My education suffered, and I was clueless about my career. I tried to understand my emotions and learnt that I may be suffering from social anxiety disorder or some similar mental illness. However, regrettably, I never reached out to my parents for help, for whom I was simply too shy and needed to change myself, which I was trying. So I never got a proper diagnosis. By the time I was out of college and into the corporate world, the situation turned such that I wanted to take my life. I did not have anyone close enough to help me with this. I had some failed attempts at finding a partner or building a romantic relationship with the ones I liked, which further contributed to the chaos in my mind. But I had responsibilities towards my family, and that is what stopped me from harming myself. I finally reached out to my parents, who saw my struggle but still were unaware of a possible mental health issue. They supported me to change my study and career track. I was yet again exposed to another new world in postgraduate college. I decided to face my fears and did all I could to try and enjoy life. I pursued my passion for music; poetry was my medicine for anxiety, and in all of these, I had people to understand and support me. Yet it felt that something was still missing. Or maybe I was just forcing myself to fit in this new world. Because over time those I considered my friends started getting distant, I kept failing at trying to find a romantic relationship, and my career did not seem to be going in the expected direction. I was surrounded by loneliness and uncertainty. I had my family to support and take care of me, but I couldn't share my internal struggles with them. I turned desperate for emotional intimacy, but I kept failing. The turn I took in life ended up leading to a new road of challenges, and my mental health deteriorated. I decided to take another leap of faith in an attempt to bring life on the right track. I left the country to explore other places around the world for some time while I finished my studies. As I write this, I have been to several places and met lots of people from even more places. I don't like to say this, but the struggle continues. But so does hope, that there must be some place where I really belong and someone out there who would simply understand.",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ilqmz2/my_story/,Some_Device_6857,1739138837.0,mentalillness
2140,Has my mother has waited too long?,"I (25 F) am a daughter of (48 F) mom. 20 years ago, my mother was hospitalized for a psychotic episode. She spent some time in an inpatient treatment and had to spend time living with her parents when she was released from the hospital. When she was diagnosed 20 years ago, I believe she was misdiagnosed because the system was not as robust as it is now.

Since being hospitalized, she has had three other psychotic episodes that have ended with her getting bailed out by her dad. This most recent time is different. He died four weeks ago and she was just hospitalized for the 2nd time ever. Her triggers seemed to be stress related, but even through all of these episodes of her life she has never been reevaluated, altered medications, been to therapy, etc. she’s always been offered financial bailouts. 

On top of this, she is in a crushing financial situation. She probably owes a hundred thousand dollars in debt repayment and also has a mortgage that she still owes about $300,000 on. 

Every time this comes up in my life, I suggest our family holds her accountable. I really need it to be different this time, because the reality is she could really lose her house, her job, her other children who are minors, or potentially much worse— her will to live. She claims that she wants to make decisions for herself, and I believe that she really does but part of the problem is that for so long she has dragged her feet on financial matters, mental health matters, and just general well-being. Unfortunately, I don’t think we can afford to give her time.

Most recently she is asking for brain scan because she believes she has a tumor that can be removed and everything will go back to normal. This is a testament to how she believes things can be fixed super quickly and life can continue without much effort. 

I think it’s pretty obvious that she has to be diagnosed in order to know what kind of care she needs (and to continue on FMLA from her job). But I’m having trouble believing she will do any of this voluntarily. I’m really at a loss for what to do. I have spent far too many years parenting my own mother.",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ili1q7/has_my_mother_has_waited_too_long/,curiouschachalaca,1739117246.0,mentalillness

2143,I feel that I am lacking,"I’m 18, currently in my second year of university, and taking a course on the side. I have a clear vision for my future, and I’m actively working toward it, but sometimes I feel like I’m falling behind compared to others. I’m genuinely happy for my peers and their achievements, but I can’t help feeling jealous at times.

I’m not very active at university because, to me, it feels like a waste of time. I’d rather focus on my course and develop my skills. As a result, I don’t have many friends. When I see people my age enjoying life, I start questioning if I’m making the right choices. Will I regret this later?

I know that what I’m doing now will pay off in the future, and I understand that sacrifices are necessary. But even with that knowledge, I still feel lonely sometimes. There are moments when I feel a mix of jealousy, regret, and isolation, and it makes me question myself. I’ve always been kind and willing to help others, yet these feelings make me wonder if I’m being selfish.

I also can’t shake off the feeling of being unaccomplished. I know I have a vision, and I don’t want to stay in this phase for too long. My current goal is just a checkpoint toward something much bigger, something far away. But what if I never get there? That thought scares me.

2149,Why am I introverted and why cant I change this part of myself,"So recently I read my old psychological development at the age of 5. Development History I had a normal birth and postnatal development. My Cognitive Assessment was normal with an 100 IQ. Overall my cognitive abilities were normal to slightly above average in some areas, and you showed strengths in reasoning and pattern recognition. However, social tendencies leaned toward shyness and preference for independent activities. Parents described I was a shy kid and like to play alone. It’s inform that I was sensitive to environmental stimuli. 

Even as 21 yr adult the more I tried I try to change or the more try to build different coping strategies I still come back to my old roots and not the person idolize or want to be. 

I could say I’m a like able person but I get very distant and aloof with people. Is not cause of anxiety but i just don’t match people’s energy like that, i prefer being around people that are super chill but at the same time im a hypocrite and i get tired of those same people and then want to be around people that are more exciting. Is weird is like i need people like that in order to match other people’s energy, is kinda like Volume but socially. And that’s when i realized that’s the real me that’s the person i want to be full in control of myself and my capability. But i become very inconsistent in maintaining relationships one day i can be super excited or in good mood and the other i can be super moody or reserved or just low. And it just feels like a constant battle with who i am and who i want to be. 

Im very deep into literature, psychology, emotions and self reflection etc. but it gets to a point where im just too emotional or person or get twisted between start feeling confused.

2150,am i insane?,"for context im a 16 m. i havent told anyone about this, so bare with me. basically, i started having murderous thoughts around 9, which didnt bother me at all. i lived with them in harmony, and i never had the intention to act on them. they were about my family, friends, and certain people that pissed me off. over time i had grown to realize that none of this was normal, but i still ignored it. along with these thoughts, ive been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. also, i was dealing with other shit all by myself. i never had  anyone in this world that was truly there for me. lets just say i went through a decent amount of girls at a young age, and i was never the one to break it off. eventually, i thought it was getting better and healing, but then it all went downhill. ive grown heartless and im more reckless than ever. usually, id be able to control my feelings pretty easily, but now its like im a little boy again. i forgot to add that i have anger issues too. im sure i have way more undiagnosed illnesses, but i cant describe it. i couldnt even talk about it because ive forgotten. i think its something about the brain forgetting the trauma to help me survive. back to the topic, ive been wanting to kill anyone who i have a grudge against. whenever i get mad, which happens pretty often, i immediately start thinking of blowing the brains out of the person. im always planning and its getting tiring. im literally going insane because i cant carry out my thoughts. theres these voices in my head that just wont go away, but thats expected. they dont really bother me anymore, but they fuel my intent to kill. thats he biggest problem i have as of right now. for anyone who has read this far, thank you for taking some time out of your day to read this. im open to any advice or thoughts.",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1il7o1g/am_i_insane/,Responsible-Ebb-7752,1739079009.0,mentalillness

2154,Treatment-resistant depression,"I (23f) have been in treatment for mental illnesses since I was 11/12 years old. 
Originally I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety, and my starter medication was Zoloft. 
In the years since, I’ve been on dozens of different medications. Some work for a while before stopping, others don’t work at all. 
I’ve also added a bunch of disorders/diagnoses, but the main ones are borderline personality disorder, major depression, generalized anxiety, bipolar 2, and severe sleep disturbance. 
I’ve been in CBT for years as well, and did DBT too. 
I’m starting to get tired of it. I hardly ever feel better, despite taking my medications and actively working with my doctor for years. 
I’ve been on Effexor for almost four years now, and I’m starting to wonder if it’s even doing anything (but my dr assures me it is and insists we don’t change it). I’m on a few others right now, but nearly every appointment we’re adding something or changing the doses or whatever. And it’s just like, WHEN am I going to feel better? 
Sleep meds that help me sleep make me depressed or zombie-like. Anxiety medications have never actually lessened my panic attacks. And despite all of my medications being some sort of anti-depressant, I still struggle daily with SI and general despair. 
My next plan is to ask for the genetic testing, and hopefully my insurance will cover it. 
I’m also looking into different therapies, like ketamine or ECT, but I’m on government insurance and getting them to approve anything other than CBT & pills is like pulling teeth.

STRONG triggers included: SA

Four days after my mother died, my younger brother left me alone in the house. The next day, while staying at my sister's place, I was sexually assaulted by her husband. My brother did absolutely nothing.I asked him to stay just one more day, but he refused, saying he had quizzes and was afraid of his lecturers. Then he called me a coward. After that, he said the most ignorant, ableist thing you could ever say to an autistic person with executive dysfunction, Dependent Personality Disorder, and mental illness. I can’t even bring myself to repeat it. It made me realize he didn’t even see me as his sister because of my mental illness.I never asked him to stay before—only this once, after our mother’s death—but he still refused. We argued, and he ignored my texts.I stayed with my sister because I couldn’t be in that huge, empty house alone. One night, I dreamed my late mom had recovered, and I told her to come home. She smiled at me. Then I woke up.Someone was touching my body. I thought it was my sister, so I didn’t react at first. But then they almost touched my breast and tried to hug me. This went on for a while. I finally glanced over. It was my brother-in-law.I shot up from the bed. He stopped. His eyes were closed. I wondered if he thought I was my sister. He’s a bit aloof, and I sometimes think he might be autistic, too, so I wasn’t sure if it was mistaken identity or if he was actually asleep.I left the room. When he came out, I told him I was going back home. He casually said, “Oh, but I’m going to work, and the key would be with me.” I lied and said, “No, I’m going straight to the office.” He just nodded. He seemed completely unbothered. I struggle with reading expressions, but he did not seem concerned.I stayed at a friend’s house for the night and texted my brother about what happened. He saw the message but didn’t reply. I knew he wouldn’t react, but I wanted him to remember this when he grows up and acts like he’s mature.I didn’t tell my sister. She depends on her husband for everything, and we have no other male figure in the house. Our parents are gone, and our cousins aren’t involved in our lives. I only have my sister, and I can’t bear to live alone. My younger brother judges me solely by my age, ignoring my autism, ADHD, and other conditions. He never offers to help me manage my symptoms—he sees me as less than human.But the memory of what happened haunts me. Am I the asshole for not telling my sister?",11,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ikmd7g/brother_says_he_hates_me_because_of_my_autistic/,QuietFoundation5464,1739018294.0,mentalillness

2159,"22M - Feeling Lost, Struggling to Connect, and Overthinking Everything","Hey everyone, I’m 22M and not sure where to post this because I don’t know what’s causing these issues.

Over the past four years, I’ve noticed a big change in myself. I used to be naturally social, joyful, and engaged in life. Now, everything feels different—I’m more negative, I have trouble focusing, and socializing feels forced. I overthink everything I say before and after I speak, and I don’t feel excitement in conversations anymore. Instead, I often feel anxious.

My mind is constantly running with excessive thoughts, often about useless things. When someone talks to me, especially when they share multiple ideas, I lose focus easily and struggle to stay engaged. My own speech has changed too—I used to be able to expand on ideas, but now I mostly speak in short, simple statements. It feels like I’ve lost my ability to truly connect with people.

I also rarely feel good about anything anymore. Sometimes, out of nowhere, I feel really down, like I do right now. I’ve become way more self-aware than before, but not in a good way. I don’t find things fun anymore, and people don’t seem to connect with me like they used to. I used to have a unique sense of humor and was always coming up with pranks, but now I feel quiet, forced in conversations, and stuck in awkward silences.

In social situations, I *always* worry about not having things to say—*before*, *during*, and *after* conversations. I try *too hard* to keep things going, and it’s exhausting. I used to be able to just *be myself*, but now it feels like I’m constantly forcing it.

The thing is, I *want* to socialize and connect. It’s not that I don’t want to—I *do*! I’m a very social person at heart. But for some reason, I just *can’t* anymore. I’m motivated to improve, to get better, but I can’t seem to find the root of the problem.

I don’t enjoy life like I used to, and I don’t know why. Could this be ADHD? Depression? Anxiety? Maybe even withdrawals from quitting porn? Or all of the above?

The only time I truly feel good is after a gym session. That’s it.

I know it’s hard to diagnose anything over Reddit, but I just want to see if anyone can relate.

# Some background info:

In the past four years:

* I tried alcohol and occasionally smoked cannabis.
* I abused porn.
* My mom got depressed, which affected me.
* I went through a lot of college stress (I was studying engineering).

Now, I’ve made changes:

* I quit alcohol and cannabis.
* I go to the gym every day.
* I’m quitting porn (had a 100-day streak before relapsing, now on a 30-day streak).

I stopped drinking at parties because alcohol gave me terrible hangovers. The following days, I would feel extremely negative and down. After noticing this pattern, I decided to quit. For some reason, hangovers don’t seem to affect my friends the same way—they’re still able to function and seem much more emotionally stable the next day.

Since making these changes, my low mood has improved *a little*, but I still don’t feel alive. I still struggle to connect with people, overthink everything, and have a terrible attention span. I also feel like I’ve lost my creativity.

The weird thing is, I remember getting high on marijuana six months ago, and it made me feel like *me* again—completely present, no constant inner monologue, happy, spontaneous, creative, funny, talkative, making jokes, and the center of the room. People get high for fun, but for me, it felt like it *fixed* something in my brain, even if only temporarily.

Before anyone says I’m just depressed—I don’t feel like I’m 24/7 beating myself up. There are *okayish* times, you know? It’s not all doom and gloom. But these issues are really affecting my quality of life, especially because they *weren’t* here four years ago.

Does anyone relate to this? Any advice or insights? Sometimes I wonder if years of watching porn (since 17) messed me up, but even as I quit and make progress, I still feel like this...

i want to hurt people. it’s not something i realistically think i will ever act on, but it scares me. 
i was diagnosed with sociopathy a few years ago. i have a really hard time with impulse control and generally behaving “normally.”
because of this ive found myself reacting more and more violently. now its to the point that i obsess over hurting people and animals. tbh ive even been fantasizing about murder and killing things.

i used to cope with it better by self harming and seeing my own deep insides. but now i’m not really sure what to do besides continuing to work on it in therapy,, but what if it isn’t enough?

2164,I'm unsure if I'm a rapist,"

I can't trust my own mind anymore. I've never been accused of rape and I have a positive relationship with everyone I've ever been intimate with. I am myself a victim of sexual assault, an event which occurred in the past year. I am re-evaluating my early intimate experiences after that event and realizing I often relied on non-verbal cues, kissing without asking and operating on assumptions rather than verbal consent. I am absolutely disgusted with myself and horrified to my core by the idea that I took advantage of someone I care about. I don't know what to do. Should I go to the police? If they can gather evidence and find a suitable punishment for me based on that I would gladly accept any conclusion but I am worried about dragging someone I potentially hurt into the process of a trial, having read about the costs and how often for victims the process can be more traumatising than the event. Not making excuses it's just a worry I've had wishing to minimise harm done. Who should I reach out to I want to get better I don't want to hurt or have hurt anyone but I can't help feeling that I already have done.
All my memories are from when I was 14 and 15 which was over 10 years ago I can't make sense of them.

But on the other, I don’t know if my life has “improved”. My career has fully stagnated while I took time to get better. My body has gained so much weight that is hard to lose due to a health condition. I live in the same apartment, sleep in the same bed. Everything the same.

I’ve had new experiences which is nice. I learned how to do watercolour painting and went to a few shows. Hung out with friends. But I’m struggling to put weight behind those things right now so it just feels like nothing in my life or the world would be different if I had just been successful that night.

Whenever I am in a major depressive episode, my brain feels cloudy/fuzzy and my thoughts are just shallow, like it's only negative thoughts but still my brain can't function properly. I've tried doing homework while in this state before and would take me hours to do because I can't focus and/or read anything. For example, it'll be me rereading the same few words for hours on end until the episode ends. To the point where if I try to talk out loud it isn't anything coherent because my brain is not thinking about forming sentences before I speak them. Also, it's like I can't move, like I'll be so in my own thoughts that I am unable to actually move even if I want to. It's like the best way I can put it is my brain is telling me ""ok you can move now"" but my body isn't listening. I've researched the immobility and it comes up as catatonia but I feel as though the symptoms of catatonia sound way worse than what I go through so now I am just confused.

I don't want to talk to the people in my life about what I'm going through. I don't even want to call outside sources. I'm writing on a reddit post about how I feel. I feel I'm fake. I feel these horrible feelings. I think about the prospects of suicide yet I would never act on such an illogical thought. I tell myself I don't have problems. You have top notch grades. You take all the hardest classes. All A+. You have college credits. You out excel in the activities you do and you have many standout positions. You're the head of a club and vice to another. You have experience on massive stages. I just feel like I have no reason to feel any of these things yet I do. I don't understand. I want to cry but I can't. I want to smile at the fact I wrote that. This whole thing even. It's stupid. Their is no reason for me to write this. No good reason that is. I just want to know why I feel this way. Why I think horrible things. Why I'm so impulsive. Even then it's hypocritical for me to say that because I am so successful at the point I'm currently. I have loving parents. When I was younger my impulsiveness and energy were veiwed as annoying. Everybody thought I was. When I got to highschool it changed when others saw how much work I put into what I was interested in. I have friends. I have happiness. I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't feel happy. But that's stupid because why would you not. I feel like nothing really impacts me. I feel so 2d and like nothing really affects me. Once again I know this isn't true because I have felt before and have cried. Yet I'm here and not talking to my family. Most likely because I think that they'll think it's stupid and I'm just going to be an annoyance. I thought about taking drugs recently. Obviously nothing detrimental but when people say they take them they feel something. Want to feel. I feel like I dont. I feel so, so very fake. Yet Ill go to bed and be the same as always. Always happy. Always full of energy. Even if I do get mad or sad I default back to feeling happy so quickly. Like I said I feel nothing impacts me. My dog died from a high fall and cracked his head on concrete. We found him the next morning dead. I was overcome with grief in the moment but the day after I was perfectly fine. Back to how I always was. Nothing wrong. Just me. Yet I feel so hypocritical. Why should I feel anything like this. I'm happy. I have a good life. Okay, I'm going to stop ranting. If anybody actually reads all this. Please tell me what you think is wrong with me. That sounds stupid and I feel stupid for saying that. I know I can't get any 'real' help from the Internet and do I even need any. Probably not. I'm just being stupid and going through a 'phase'. I don't know. Like I said at the beginning.

2168,Chronic pain is ruining my life,"I AM 18 years old male 


My problems with my pain have been effecting me everyday of my life and with every task that I like to do in my life and just feel if this is how I’m gonna be living the rest of my life then I would rather not be here.

It all started around 2 years ago when I started getting mild random pains in different body parts but thought nothing of it as was not alarming to me anyways fast forward a year from that and the pain increased by a major amount and along with this the pain was a daily thing in my life still I had hope at this point in time and had faith the doctors would be able to fix the issue. 

Fast forward to today and my life is just becoming he’ll I’m in extreme pain for most of the day wether I’m doing activity’s or not it’s affecting my college and work and even was going to quit both of them because it was just unbearable to work as can’t stand up for more than 30mins without my knees completely giving out. I’ve had 10+ appointments with doctors and it just seems I’m getting nowhere they haven’t done anything to point me in the right direction to being cured and I have just accepted that they will not be able to cure this as chronic pain is very hard to diagnose. 

I’m just really hopeless my life has gone to shit and can’t see myself doing anything with it it’s destroying my friendships, my relationships with parents . Everyday has been the same for the last year I’ll go to work get through the day in extreme pain which makes work 10x worse then go home and my legs feel like I’ve just ran a marathon. 

I am really passionate about the gym and have been for the past year and a half and it’s the only thing that I really love doing and has helped with my confidence so much but with these pains i just feel like my dream and the only thing that I am good at doing, the only thing that I find joy in life and its getting taken away from me due to my body I can not go to the gym without high level of burning pain which is making me start to not enjoy it . I remeber before I had these issues and when I’d train of course it would hurt my muscles but since I’ve had this the pain of training has increased by 10x no exaggeration . 

I’m just getting to a point where I feel I’m going to end up ending it there’s just no hope left I just can not live like this for much longer I have no life anymore and have been mentally destroyed and all of these problems and I’m only 18 years old!

I have these periods where my body feels like it doesn't belong to me, or my room feels like it's not mine. There isn't anything weird or different, I just get this eerie feeling it isn't mine.

It also sometimes feels like everyone is out to kill me. I can't quit explain it, but like they're all plotting to end me. I'm convinced a few walls can talk too.

The person in the mirror doesn't feel like me. I think it's the eyes. They seem unfocused and dark. It feels like my reflection is going to attack or kill me.

2179,Went from a normal girl to an neurotic obsessive stalker in under a year,"Met a guy through a friend last February and felt instant chemistry. It was mutual -- we really hit it off and went on a couple of dates immediately after that. I was so excited and couldn't keep my mind off him. I'd never really been into guys my entire life, but things suddenly clicked that time and I was so happy.

Then he gave me the classic talk about not wanting a serious relationship and wanting to keep things casual. A typical story that most people have probably heard and been disappointed about right? Just find another person right? Instead, I continued seeing him for many months (even now) pretending to be okay with casually dating. Meanwhile, I...

* Read through his texts with other girls while he was in the bathroom, and even screen recorded them so I could read them over on my phone after (I've literally read like 50 days worth of texts he had with one girl from Tinder over 30 times at least, I could literally recite his entire relationship)
* With that particular girl, I spent hours researching everything I could possibly find about her and deeply considered making a fake instagram account so that I could follow her and see her pictures, but luckily got too lazy for that lol
* He gave me his location, so I check it around maybe 20+ times per day - I wish I were exaggerating but I'm seriously not. When he's at home, I feel relieved. When he's not, my eyes are literally glued to the screen and I have to track him as he moves toward his destination.
* When I suspect he's on a date based on his location, I completely mentally shut down and become dysfunctional for the next two days at least.
* Every day I feel tense and anxiously check my phone until he texts me. My screen time is so high because I will sometimes think that I should have my phone open so that I can see his text immediately as it comes. I am unable to focus on basically anything else until he texts me that day.
* If he doesn't text me for a day or two I will literally go into full mental crisis mode and call everyone I know, bawl my eyes out, and fantasize about suicide.
* Almost forgot to add this one! I keep a Google Photos album with maybe a hundred pictures of him that either I took, he took, or my friends took. I look at it multiple times per day.
* Also forgot to add this one, and I'm especially scared by it, but I take pictures of him while he's not looking... like all the time. So I can look at it later.
* If the nair in the shampoo trick worked and was undetectable I would literally do it to him so that other girls wouldn't like him. And yes I know that makes me a horrible person.

Guys I'm literally nuts. Like actual bananas. No one would ever know it because I'm an attractive young girl with a LOT going for me (I have a close knit group of genuine friends, a loving family, I come from an upper middle class background, I make a high salary) but I genuinely am suffering every single day and I am acting like a psychotic stalker.

Now for my question, does talk therapy or medication help with this kind of thing?

2186,IOP clinic balmed me for not getting better,"Two months ago, I started an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) at Collective Care Clinic, hoping it would finally help. But now, with only one week left, I’ve only gotten worse.
I finally spoke up about how much I was struggling and how this therapy wasn’t working for me. I brought it up three times before I was able to speak to one of the directors, and when I did, he was cold and dismissive. Instead of listening to me, he told me that this was the only kind of therapy that could ever work for me. He made it seem like IOP was my last shot at getting better. At one point, he even said, “What are we gonna do with you?” as if I was a nuisance to them because treatment didn’t work 
It felt like he was more interested in selling me on the program than actually helping me. Saying things like “well we have the best care you can find so I don’t know where you’ll go from here”. I kept trying to explain that I was getting worse and I wanted to look into other types of therapy but he wouldn’t even consider that the approach of this therapy might not be the right fit for me. I left the conversation feeling completely hopeless.
Has anyone else had a therapist or treatment program blame them when things didn’t work? How did you move forward after an experience like this? Right now, I just feel lost and like I don’t know where to go from here.

2189,Need support.  Brother currently in hospital detoxing but im terrified,"
My brother (ill call him steve) is 43 and has always had mental health/substance abuse issues ever since he return home from Iraq 20 years ago. He does not work, has never had a significant other, and the only time he leaves his house is to go to the bar. When hes on his meds, he does act like a somewhat normal person and will visit my parents time to time to visit or have dinner with them. However, the past few years it has been the worst its ever been. Last year, there was a day he was off of his medications he gets from the VA because he said he ‘doesnt need them anymore’. Well that combined with his severe alcoholism resulted in him texting all of us siblings very bizarre things that didn’t make sense. As well as threats to reveal secrets that he ‘had on us’ to everyone he knows and even went so far as to make threats on ours and our parents lives. It was a very scary night where none of us knew what to do. We were scared if we were to call the cops, he would try to shoot them or himself, so instead we did nothing. My parents  even had to make a makeshift bolt lock for their house door because of the threats. The next morning, Steve acted as if nothing had happened when he was back on his medications again. We had told him what he had done and he essentially shrugged his shoulders.  

Fast forward to a week ago. He stopped taking his meds again and drank a case of beer. He texted one of my brothers (ill call Bob) creepy messages alluding to the fact that he was going to stab him. Bob lives in a different state so he did not reply. Because he didnt reply or would not interact with him, Steve called their local police department with an ‘anonymous tip’ that Bob is sexually abusing his adopted son. He did this for the sole purpose of getting Bobs attention that way. We are all livid. 

The next morning when Bob revealed this to the family, my dad called the police to do a welfare check on Steve. When the cops came, Steve was very pissed but said that he would go with my dad to the hospital to get checked out and to detox.

Hes been up at the hospital now for the past 4 days detoxing and he is livid with my parents for putting him there. My parents have tried to go up there a visit, but Steve denies them. He is on suicide watch because he says hes had thoughts of suicide, as well as hurting other people. Currently, he is now being transferred to the VA hospital to continue the detox as well as work with psychiatrists. 

I guess I am just writing this because I am very scared. Terrified actually. Im scared that when he gets out, he is going to hurt my parents physically and punish them for making him get help. Im scared that he is going to lie to the hospital and pretend that he is getting better so he can get out as early as possible. Im scared that he is just sitting in there plotting revenge. I talk about my fears with my parents but they get angry with me because they dont want me thinking like that but I cant help it. It is consuming my thoughts and I feel like I am driving myself crazy. I do hope this helps my brother but I cant help but think these horrible outcomes.

2196,Emotional dependent to my husband,"

Hey guys, I’m new here! 

Me (F23) and my husband (M28) really need some help how to minimise my emotional dependency on him. I’m freshly diagnosed with BPD and on medication (ca. 1 week). 
Today we had a really bad fight  because of my high sexual needs and his regular rejections cause he’s not that often horny. When he rejects me, I often get in really high emotional tension, which of course also affects him. 

Do you have some tips for me so I can work on that?

2197,having breakdown need advice,"(I am going to be a crybaby sore loser, my friends and family have told me countless times already)

I go to my car ive spent the last 2 years building and spent endless money on to find mice eating my wiring harness. Car is not for an inspector to see as it will get flagged. well out of straight not thinking and panic i get my mother to call them. car gets flagged its getting taken. i get $0 for damage unrelated to wgat i called for but im delusional. The thing is is auto tech school starts in a week. this absolutely killed my passion. im not doing it anymore as i have no motivation to touch a car. But as a result of this i took my outburst on my friends family and random people on the internet. why does everything i do end in a failure and i cant finish anything? like if i crashed and was at fault like yea i doubt this would have happened. But idk what to do. feel like its all over and i lost everyone and everything. dont need pity or anything everyone was telling me i was being a bitch and crybaby about it but they dont understand everything i put into this. the day it happened i think i instantly got blackout drunk and posted on my story that everything in my car is free like the tools and stuff. I am to the point where nothing interests me even drugs or alcohol. and all of this happened after i got clean from a 4 month addiction so i dont understand why i try to do good for myself and i get this. Im starting to feel like either my family or someone sabotaged me on purpose and i am believing it. i have not taken my meds since drinking a bottle of whiskey every night as they did not like each other. havent been on them since but if i was im sure i would have the same reaction. I have 2 options. Find a way to accidentally die, or hop in the 200k mile daily and just take off 12 hours away for miami and say nothing. Everyone is already blocked and all socials are deleted. I feel like my friends family tormenting me and really do not care until something really happens. i tried to buy a gun and got denied the other day because of being in a mental hospital in the last 5 years.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ijknhv/having_breakdown_need_advice/,NoSwitch4467,1738895774.0,mentalillness
2198,Me or my boyfriend will die soon,"A sense of impending doom that I haven’t been able to shake for months. Anytime the near future is mentioned, my mind immediately tells me I’ll be dead by then. If my boyfriend says he wants to do something a year from now, my brain just goes, “That won’t happen because he’ll be dead.” It DEVASTATES me.

There have been a few times at night when he’s sleeping, and I just cry and cry because I’m so grateful we’re both alive, that we didn’t die that day, that I can touch and hug him. But it freaks me out because it feels like I’m grieving someone who’s still alive.

My thought process is this: So many people die every day—SO many. It makes no sense that it won’t be me or someone I love.
People tell me, “Death can happen anytime. That’s why you have to live in the present and be grateful.” But that’s literally my problem. I’m fully aware of that. I’m so ""grateful"" that I cry my eyes out way too often, and it doesn’t feel healthy.

People also say, “You just have to accept that death is a natural part of life.” I know that too. Rationally, I have a decent relationship with the idea of death. But my brain immediately kills off either me or someone I love the second the future gets mentioned. It's not a conscious choice. It’s like my brain files it under “Facts,” and I just respond emotionally like anyone would if they knew death was near.

I hate this feeling of certainty about something so horrible—something that most likely won’t even happen.

I guess this is just a rant, but I’m curious: Has anyone ever felt this way? How do you deal or how did you deal with it?
I was borderline OCD as a kid, and I feel like it might be related, but I really don’t know.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ijkaik/me_or_my_boyfriend_will_die_soon/,Massive_Post_167,1738894665.0,mentalillness
2199,Need help for gf,"So, my girlfriend (17) was talking to me yesterday and mentioned how she has been feeling for some time.

Context: Me and my gf are in a LDR and we are in India and we both are students, she has been preparing for this exam and has been doing coaching and has not been going to school for the past 2 years.

She talked about how ""she has given up on everything and that she is becoming numb"" and she does not care about anything and it's like she would shed a few tears but it doesn't feel anything. She didn't ask for advice because it wouldn't impact/motivate her.

She has previously done sh but she hasn't done it in recent times because ""She doesn't feel something if she does it"". She also mentioned how she wants to disappear and have everyone forget about her. And then she said that even if she disappeared it wouldn't matter to many people except ""you or my family"" like people would be shocked but it won't be like they cannot function without her.

She has said that she doesn't get suicidal thoughts as well.

I suggested telling it to her parents but like her mom's sick and she doesn't wanna freak them out, I don't know what much I can do, I do feel that this might be a case of depression but anyone who has gone through something can help, that'd be appreciated.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ijap77/need_help_for_gf/,TeachAsleep5325,1738869287.0,mentalillness
2200,Split,"On my friends account, due to lack of trust with in my family. 42 year old f 
I have suffered for years with mental illness, I was shunned by family because I was different, I thought different, and they were scared of me sometimes ( not that I hurt anyone).
I never understood why I was treated differently, I don't think they understood either.
Every little comment would hurt me sometimes and it still hurts sometimes.
I left them nearly 20 years ago I had to be on my own, living my own life, my own rules, being free from them, 
I moved as far as I the money I had could take me, 
I lost contact with those family members after a while. 

I worked on my own mental health for many years, learning what was ""wrong"".
It wasn't until I realized that something wasn't ""wrong"" with me, that I realized that I wasn't alone in my brain.
After I got married (11yrs now) I told my husband everything I have been going through, 
After a few years he said to me you change with your moods, when you are upset and someone has hurt whom you love, you are like a train, won't stop until you get what you want. when you are upset with yourself you are quite and you make yourself sick. 
By friends I have been told I scare them enough to run and hide when I'm on a war path, but these same friends have told me they would stand in front of a speeding train. 
After speaking with a professional,
 She said it is split personality disorder, 
I was on medication for years that made me worse (prescription from old doctor). That made me feel sleepy, I couldn't keep a job, or a house, I lost my kids, because I couldn't feed them.
Since I have reconnected to my culture (not family) I have learnt many coping skills, natural medications and excise, yes my personalitys are still there. But I have learnt to work with them.
Recently my personalitys have been triggered since a return of certain family members (parents siblings) 
They have fallen on hard times due to own fault.
I have been wanting to talk to someone who isn't apart of my family, I love my husband and I talk to him but he has so much to worry about I do not want to mess with his own mental health journey, 
I think I just need friends I can talk to that won't judge me because they don't understand, or they don't want to. 
The thoughts that I am not enough have been coming back.
And I'm scared I don't want to fall back into the old habits, 
I have changed my life, I'm about to start back at school to get my degree in social services, 
And I need to be focused on that.

for clarification i’m 99% sure i have borderline personality disorder (self diagnosed, which i’m aware is bad for a lot of people as it’s becoming much more common, but for my situation it would make a lot of sense if i went into deep detail about my life up until this point and how i was treated and how much ive been isolating from a VERY young age, but its too personal to me to talk about on here so i wont get into it) but ive never heard of it causing the multiple personalities/voices? correct me if im wrong but im worried its something else aswell which is terrifying as im completely clueless atp",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ij0sb9/i_dont_know_what_is_wrong_with_me/,evieue,1738842761.0,mentalillness

2206,"I had manic portraying episodes, what we’re they actually??!","When I was hospitalized last year I was having a lot of issues it started with me uncontrollably violently slamming my head against every surface close to me. I was such a danger I had to sit in the middle of the hallway inbetween staff. I was getting sedatives non stop, I was in holds from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed. I was so gone, I sat in that plastic chair and stared at the floor 9+ hours of the day. I was so severely dehydrated as well I almost died. After a trip in the ambulance and a week in the ER I was sent to another facility for a week came home and then a week later went to another one. This is where the manic portraying episodes apeared, I would get this extreme chaotic feeling, I'd loose all impulse control, I couldn't help but laugh and smile and yell and cry because of such strong emotions I felt, I would again slam my head but it was different I was doing it more chaotically, and the biggest thing I was rearranging heavy duty prison chairs jumping and running all over them, I would make a mess of everything shred everything jump on tables. Completely out of control. I remember I described it as mappy, mad, and happy. It was so extreme. The staff said my eyes were dilated extremely wide and a lot of them mentioned it as a manic episode however they didn't end up confirming it. The doctor who wasn't there had said possibly a reaction to childhood truama however all my childhood truama had been resolved with EMDR, it also has never effected me in such a way before. 
It also wasn't like I was wanting attention or trying to be funny, I just felt such extreme chaos. That's the best way to describe it. I still wonder what made me break? And what kind of beak was it?

2209,Possibly saying goodbye to a big part of me,"I want to preface that I’m dumping this here (if it even belongs here) because I am starting ssris soon and I cannot honestly die with this or forget it ever existed. This is such a big part of me that I’m so scared to lose and maybe this will help someone, Maybe it won’t. I just want someone out there to know about it even if only one person reads this that’s all I care about. (I do not want to die rn and have no plans of that atm. )

For my sake I’m not going to refer to this place/action/thing by the name I gave it. When I say pretend do take it as a noun sometimes. I’m sorry if that’s confusing. 

I never had many friends as a kid, didn’t go out much I didn’t care because I was very content playing imaginary in my room. The years went on and it never stopped. Something very traumatic happened when I was 12, definitely something traumatic enough to harm a developing brain. I did nothing about it, I said nothing, I went home and played “pretend” and never spoke about it again. Time went on and it got worse, if I went a certain amount of time without pretending I’d get irritated and upset. I couldn’t go to sleepovers and if I did I’d ask to go home to guess what? Pretend! 

The whole act of pretend was running up and down my kitchen or room listening to very specific music for what would sometimes be hours on end. I never mean to do that. I go downstairs to make food and the next thing I know it’s been three hours and there’s tears in my eyes from the hunger pains that I couldn’t feel. It’s worse when I’m outside, I’ll only mean to go to the shop about 5 minutes away and the next thing I know I’m in the town over. Clearly I’ve some road awareness idk? 

I don’t know what goes on around me physically you could say I’m disassociating (?) idk what that really entails but the definition adds up. But I do know what’s going on inside pretendland. I am always me I think. And the characters that make up the stories are always people I know, there are some reoccurring characters that are people I’ve never met or seen before but they r cool so they stay ig. I control everything but I don’t at the same time. It’s not like a dream it is so vivid and real to me. I’ve had three bad people in my life. And each of them ment something to me once, so obviously they were there but they were always like the bad guys of the story ig you could say, and then they did what the did and disappeared. People come and go from pretend like they do in my life but at different times. I’m not trying to say I’m a psychic or anything I just don’t understand what this is or why I do this, it has fully consumed my life but I love it so much. Pretend keeps me safe. 

I fear the “me” inside pretend isn’t actually me. Sometimes I genuinly feel like she is a different person but we can’t communicate at all. That’s what pretend is, it’s how we speak without speaking. I only really became conscious of pretend after the event when I was 12. I realised then something was wrong and this wasn’t normal. There are tears coming out of my eyes right now but I’m not upset I think she’s mad at me for talking shit abt her behind her back, this happens a lot whenever I try to vocalise or even just write down about this. I’ve only ever spoken to one person about this before who absolutely just does not believe me, thinks I just daydream a lot but it’s not that it’s so different in a way i physically just cannot describe. After I spoke about it tho pretend got very fucky for a long time. She REALLY wasn’t happy about that, if she even is there 

This might not mean anything. But it’s so real to me and I’m scared whatever my doctor decides to put me on that I’ll lose this. It’s consumed me wholly but I love it so much I am genuinely nothing without it. If it wasn’t for this I don’t know what or who I would be. It’s never been wrong about any feeling it’s had about anyone, I trust it completely, I am something in that little world in my head, I have a purpose in there, I see and hear my friends when I can’t see or hear them.

2214,Ever been thought of as less by someone with mental illness?,"I had this in my head for over a year and I just wanted to come somewhere I felt I could at least get an opinion on this matter. So I, 24F, have high-function autism and I've been perceived & acted somewhat as child-like for most of my life until I got around my late teens when I had started to ""grow up"" as in a way, being more adult-like.

So early last year, I learned from someone who I used to be in a Discord with that the server owner/creator, who also has a mental illness (DID system), and that they referred to me as child-like and I needed to be talked to as if I'm a child.

  
As I'm sure fellow people who have autism, being called & referred to as child-like when we're fully functioning adults who can perform daily functions without assistance, feels incredibly offensive/demeaning. The fact that it came from someone who is also dealing with mental illness just hurts more because you'd think that they would understand more about what it's like to have something, even if it's not the same thing. And I have talked to this person when it was themself speaking & not one of their alters speaking so it's not like they weren't aware of that. 

I just wanted to know if anyone else had to deal with something like what I had where a fellow individual with mental illness thought of me as less of a person because of specifically what I have.

(I also wanted to be clear I tried to address their DID as respectfully as I could even if I don't have it, they said those things towards me, & if I don't fully understand it given what causes & how individuals manage a condition like that.)",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iincje/ever_been_thought_of_as_less_by_someone_with/,emmie796,1738795771.0,mentalillness

2216,"Those with ADHD, please help me","Hello everybody. I’m reaching out to Reddit because I literally don’t know what else to do. I'm here for some advice and honest feedback about whether or not my current issues might support the possibility of me having ADHD, if it’s just my personality, or if it’s something else entirely. For context, I’m a 15 year old male and I have had no prior disorder diagnoses. I was venting to my friend about my current issues with procrastination, feeling stuck, demotivation etc., and she said it reminded her a lot of her experience with ADHD.

I’m an incredibly social person, but I end up crashing at the end of the day. Just feeling fatigued, drained, and it has led to my mother beginning to worry about my mental health. She thinks it’s possible I’m depressed, but I just don’t see it. I feel happy most of the time, but I just have these mood swings. I put off basic tasks for so long and I don’t know why. It could be something as simple as taking a shower. I want to, but I just cant. So I end up doing things very late when I absolutely have to. This bleeds into my school work as well. I get pretty good grades, but I pretty much wait until the very last second to start my work (Beginning my homework at 11:15 when it’s due at midnight), and it’s just so frustrating. This ends up making me feel even more unmotivated and unenthusiastic about things. These patterns have gotten a lot worse in the past year or so, which also makes me second guess because I know ADHD is supposed to develop and be clear in early childhood. I feel a bit cautious about confronting my mom about this all, because she doesn’t really see that side of me. I kind of just shut down when I get home at the end of the day, so I can see why she might jump to depression. I’ve taken a few online tests to mixed results, so I’m not sure if I should really do anything about it. Please let me know, do I just have a kind of lazy personality? Or does this sound like ADHD or depression to you?",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iiqo8m/those_with_adhd_please_help_me/,Spirited-Occasion366,1738804949.0,mentalillness

2218,I’m scared I’m about to relapse my eating disorder,"My boyfriend has been withdrawn since this past Saturday, even though when he dropped me off everything between us seemed perfectly fine. We were supposed to see each other today but yesterday he told me he didn’t want to hangout just saying he wanted alone time. And today I went and got my hair done, a drastic change so I was super excited to show him. He hadn’t answered any of my texts so I stupidly decided to call him like three times in a row. Fucking dumbest decision cause he then said I was overwhelming me. And then after not responding for a bit and me freaking out, had a panic attack, and sent him a messaging apologizing for being overbearing. He then sent me back a message and said I just needed to give him space and stop spamming and that “it’s too much for him”. Since then I’ve been doing nothing but crying and have complete lost my appetite. I already haven’t been eating since this weekend, worried about what’s going wrong in my relationship and now after today, just the thought of food is making me nauseous.
But maybe it’s for the best. Maybe he’s not finding me as attractive? Maybe losing weight will help? 

And before anybody tries to say “break up with him” that’s not happening. I’m too in love. And honestly most of this may be in my head. He also has bad depression and I think maybe he’s in a funk and i am fucking up by not giving him space to process.

I don’t know. I’m just losing my mind. I won’t be texting or calling until he reaches out first. I don’t want to break a boundary that he has bow placed.

2220,"Confession: someone in my dorm passed, and I feel like Im making it about me","SO! long story... but I'm a college student, 20 years old and live on a dorm! Last semester-literally the last day of the semester on the 20th I attempted suicide got spooked by the blood and called 911 and blah blah spent the weekend in the hospital- whatever cute stuff right. That's not the part that really got me- like yes kinda traumatic, but anyways winter break goes on and I'm having trouble registering for classes (mostly because I never registered for spring since I thought was supposed to yk be dead) so I move back to campus ONE week late, so I miss the first week of the semester. Mind you, my roommates are like what the fuck (I never told them what happened- they were already home when this occurred) why haven't you moved in yet, I lied and said I was sick. Finally a week after spring semester is going on I solve my registration issues with my college and they let me move in, its exactly 1 month after mu suicide attempt my roommates still don't know or my close college friends, only one friend from my building knew and she is my friend and lives a few floors down.

So I'm in my dorm for 2 hours max and all the sudden I see cop cars and an ambulance- the same amount that came when I attempted suicide in December, Im looking out the window I recognize them I'm like wtf. My roommates and I hear wailing/screaming coming from downstairs and I instantly think she sounds just like me the night the EMTs were trying to calm me down wtf is going on. My friend texts me like ""this can't be you again bitch"" and I'm like nahh thinking it's like ironic. This whole ordeal lasts a few hours, but we don't get to see what happens and no one tells us what happened but we hear from girls on the floor below us that they swear by 3 am they saw them take out a body bag. Days later its confirmed the girl killed herself. NOW I'm so.. just lost about this, because the way our dorms are set up it's like small houses, our house literally has a total of 16 rooms each dorm has 3-4 people. WHAT are the chances? And I hate to make this about me, but it's killing me and I can't talk to this to too many people, the day I finally move back I see THIS? What are the chances? not just my dorm, but a few floors down in my house, a girl, my year, my age, her name sounds like mine, she started out in the same summer program that I started in 2022 so I recognized her from the pictures I saw. I never talked to her, and I feel guilty making her suicide about me, but this feels.. I don't know otherworldly? Crazy? Like is it stupid to make this about me?

I was SO close to death, like incredibly close, and then I come back and the first thing I see is the same thing other students probably saw when I called 911- except this time she died. Am I evil for making this about me? I feel so bad, but part of me just can't help but think coincidence is INSANE. My mom also swears that the day she was waiting outside for answers while the cops and EMTs were upstairs trying to save me- she saw her trying to get into my dorm and they didn't let her. -This just feels crazy and I don't know how to explain it, and.. yeah.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iisvb6/confession_someone_in_my_dorm_passed_and_i_feel/,Party-Mechanic-9735,1738811575.0,mentalillness
2221,I want to be assaulted,"I find myself praying that I’ll be assaulted so I’ll have a reason to justify my mental state and my self-damaging actions. I believe that if I were assaulted, the people around me wouldn’t blame me for my lack of trying. I feel like it would take me out of this numbness that allows me to gaslight myself into thinking I’m fine and just being lazy and instead make me feel fear and anger, which are feelings I don’t judge myself for as much as numbness, because in my mind if I’m numb I don’t have the right to do behaviors that indicate pain or struggle, because sadness is debilitating but the lack of feeling in any direction should be neutral so why isn’t it? I want to be assaulted so that if I commit another suicide attempt, they won’t think I did it for no reason or that I just didn’t bother doing the work to heal. I want to feel like I have a reason to be upset and not like I’m making up imaginary problems or making myself feel bad and act poorly because of a whim. 

I want to feel validated and I don’t deserve that now but I would deserve that if I were assaulted.

2222,My Brain Feels Like It’s Functioning Strangely,"Hello, everyone.

Lately, I’ve been struggling with strange mental symptoms, and I really need them to go away as soon as possible.

About a month ago, I went through a difficult situation that led to a fallout with my ex-college friends. It involved mistreatment and manipulation, which has profoundly impacted my mental and emotional well-being, as well as my self-image.

I was handling the situation well enough for my state, but, my brain has been stuck in extreme survival mode since a couple weeks. I feel unable to focus, constantly dealing with brain fog, detachment from myself, and a loss of connection to my goals.

Last week I had to interact with people from my school days—people I had intentionally left behind due to past emotional issues. This situation made me feel obligated to be more empathetic towards them, even though it was emotionally exhausting.

The problem is that ever since I was exposed to them again, my brain has started functioning as it did back then—poor concentration, severe anxiety, and extreme sensitivity to external stimuli. I’ve been way more irritable than usual.

I feel disconnected from the rational, goal-oriented version of myself that I had built over the years. Before all of this, I felt like I was capable of achieving anything.

I’m not sure if this is also influenced by changes in my sleep schedule, which I’m currently trying to fix. A couple of weeks ago, I was cutting carbs from my diet, but today I ate them normally again, and nothing has changed.

I need this state to leave because I will have to be in good shape for an upcoming challenging school project and my team needs me.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading.

2224,We need to talk about something,"There’s something I don’t understand why we don’t talk about more when it comes to mental illness. Mental illness is spiritual not chemical. Can you treat symptoms on mental illness, yes but is that the goal? Why not get to the root of why mental illness happens in the first place? The truth about mental illness is that it’s about spiritual warfare. Do you feel like your purpose was stolen from you and you now have a deep existential crisis. Mental illness is about your spirit being trapped behind walls, and you now have to settle for a life you don’t really want to live. You might feel like a part of died through your trauma, which caused your identity to be taken from you. It’s a fucking grief I know. Thinking about what you could have become if that trauma didn’t happen. Or if she didn’t do that. Or if he didn’t do that. The truth is that the devil didn’t want your purpose to come into fruitition because he feared you. Why couldn’t god protect you, thats a question I ask myself very often too. You might feel like you have been attacked by multiple people that led you to more mental illness. Mental illness leaves you vulnerable to narcissistic abuse, this is why you might feel like you have been the victim of a chain reaction caused by different type of personality disorders. All you did was trying to find yourself. The devil targeted you because you were too close to god and didn’t want your purpose to come into existence. The truth is that narcs, aspds and sociopaths are the devils spawns who drives people into mental illness. What can we do about this, I don’t know but I do know that thousands of people commit suicide, because they are caught in spirit traps. Feeling like like they can never find back to themselves.

2226,ASD kid theory and pathologizing TW: brief non-detailed mentions of true crime as examples,"Little kids have extreme emotions, and aren't used to emotions at all so they pathologize. Example: angry and thinking of hurting ppl (normal) they think it isn't normal cause ppl don't talk about it, but they don't talk about it because they know they wouldn't actually hurt someone. The kid doesn't know this and takes it literally. Especially if you're autistic, you may take your own thoughts literally too, as well at being hyper fixated on maybe bad ppl, or you relate to them and radicalized yourself. Also, not everything is a disorder. Some things are just issues ALONE. Example: lack of empathy. Although aspd is CHARACTERIZED by a lack of empathy, that doesn't mean that having that one symptom means you have ASPD. Autistic kids may have their own special way of showing empathy, or may have a harder time feeling it, especially because lower empathy can be normal for a child, and anger can be a really selfish emotion. Kids never fully understand what they're capable of, and with diagnostics, they may ignore criteria such as ODD for ASPD, which they would not qualify for. A lot of kids think they will do things that they simply would not be able to do as it is against biosocial norms and evolutionarily stupid. I think true crime effected autistic kids in this way where they made it so fun and stylized and romantic, that these kids have been able to empathize just enough (a counter sign to ASPD...) that they think this is them. They get obsessed, and in some cases, it consumes them (Example: Adam Lanza). Usually, they grow out of it, but this can eat them alive forever, knowing they *were* like this. I feel this can in some cases lead to people thinking they have other things as well, like BPD and NPD. It's VERY unlikely that if you *think* you have NPD, you *actually* have it. NPDs are usually not very self-aware. And for BPD, it makes more sense, because ~12-~17 year olds can feel extreme emotions and everything i said in the first few sentances. Autism and being that age range can really cloud your vision and give you identity problems, and I just wanted to shed light on that, and hopefully if you know someone lile this, you'll worry less, and if you were this kid, don't let it eat you alive, to me, it's become a semi-normal stage of development for younger gens with ASD. The internet and these true crime stories can make it very easy to fixate, obsess, diagnose, relate, and manipulate yourself.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iiozig/asd_kid_theory_and_pathologizing_tw_brief/,channel_wormhole7,1738800138.0,mentalillness
2227,Bipolar vs adhd ?,"So I just wanted to hear what other people thought of something my therapist was saying today.
I took a neuropsych a few years ago when I was around 13 and they told me I was a “classic case” of cyclothymia and “almost” had adhd and I lived with that for a while and it was manageable with a small dose of an ssri (I also have anxiety) but recently things have been getting worse, especially my manic like symptoms, and I thought I might be developing full on bipolar 2 since I’m around the age it would happen. So I started going to therapy again and told her all my symptoms but she said it didn’t line up with mania bc I was still getting 8 hours of sleep, and didn’t go into depression afterwards plus a few other things. She said it seemed a lot more like a hyper fixation and I might have adhd. I agree that it definitely seemed like a severe hyper fixation even more than it seemed like mania but I don’t know about adhd, I don’t have any of the hyperactive symptoms and only a few of the inattentive ones (I thought those were all normal lol). 

So anyway, what do you guys think? What does mania/hyper fixation feel like to you and could one be mistaken for another? Could I maybe have adhd even though the neuropsych said I just almost had it? 

It really feels like something out of my control comes over me and completely replaces all of my interests with new ones I’m suddenly obsessed with to the point I ignore everything else and get super out of touch and hyper for a while. This happens randomly every few months with literally the most random things I didn’t care about before and don’t care about after. Is that a hyper fixation?

I felt… different. Less reactive. More in tune with life. Even my dreams became more vivid, like my subconscious was finally speaking clearly. One day, during a deep session, I had this overwhelming realization: I wanted to share this experience with others. Not just talk about it, but actually guide people through it.

So, I started creating my own meditations—ones that blend the kind of deep inner work and spiritual exploration that changed my life. It’s been surreal seeing how others connect with them.

2230,"Living in perpetual fear after doing something drastic, rash and final","TW: discussion of suicidal behaviour 
NOT AN EMERGENCY

I've been on a half decade long downward spiral. With the typical up and down waves associated with bipolar.

Every time I got back up, I would think that I had sorted my stuff and THIS time, it would stay that way.

However, each depressive episode was progressively worse. All depressive episodes had some kind of suicidal behaviour, but, with each episode, the actions became more intentional. More life-threatening.

And so, a little more than a year ago, I made an extremely life-threatening suicide attempt. I legit thought I was experiencing the process of dying (I now also have PTSD). My survival was a result of luck -- and I still don't know the actual reason I didn't die. This is the kind of luck a person gets only once in a lifetime. 

I'm grateful for my survival. But I am plagued by the question: Why is this time different? Why won't this period of semi-normalcy end with an even worse depressive-suicidal episode? 

It is clear to me that in this last attempt, I have gone as close as I can to the line between life and death,  without crossing over to the other side. So if I ever attempt suicide again, it is certain that I will die.

And so I live in perpetual fear, with every day feeling like a test. A test with my life at stake.

Was that attempt a turning point in my life?

Or is this period a temporary delay in my death?

What reason do I have to believe that this time will be different?

And if it _isn't_ different, I will be dead within the next year or two. Before my 28th birthday.

I'm scared. Properly scared.

2233,I think I might have Bipolar 2.,"I think I might have Bipolar Disorder II. TW: suicide, abuse and neglect mentions. No details.

In case it helps with advice: I have Tourettes Syndrome.

I am at odds with myself these days. I feel kind of crazy. Most of the time, I’m low. Very low. Below are the reasons I think I might have Bipolar Disorder II (among other things I can’t think of currently.) I guess I’m just…kind of venting? It feels nice to lay all of this out for the first time. But as I’m planning to seek help within the month, any advice or suggestions for when I see my future psychiatrist, as well as personal experiences of your own would put me at ease about all of this.

I was so scared for the longest time that the world was going to tell me I was fine, but I know now that I’m not—even if this isn’t my diagnosis—so I want to share some of my experiences that make me feel like I might fall into the Bipolar Disorder II category.

1. Insane mood swings—going from crying and considering hurting myself/suicide, aka the world is a dark chasm and I am a little light falling into it. Unable to do anything: new projects now seem like an impossible, dulling task. I’ll throw out everything in these bouts of depression—plans with friends, projects I’d promised to work on, money I promised to save. And then, almost overnight, I’ll be on top of the world. New hangout plans with friends, feeling creative and inspired, feeling like I’m meant for something big. So I start saving again, make new plans, new goals—all of which eventually spins out of control as I hit another wave of depression.

2. Mild to heavy dissociation. Going through the steps of everyday life, trudging as believably as I can through the motions while being a lifeless shell of actions and responses, or feeling like I’m many different personalities that fight over which opinions to believe in.

3. Memory. Being extremely forgetful and often “not there.” Serious brain fog where I’ll forget small bits of time, even if they’ve just happened seconds ago.

4. Impulsive spending. Spending up to 70 dollars on a single meal and not see a problem with it. I’ll buy big things I randomly want, like a tv, without much thought, even when I’ve promised myself to save.

5. Bouts of determination. I’ll clean my room at 3am, or be suddenly full of inspiration and ideas because I’ve watched ONE YouTube video and convinced myself I can build an entire house on my own—only to crash when I realize it’s too big of a project.

6. Overwhelmed easily. A full work week is a lifetime, and every day builds on me, making me break into tears. Too many projects, too many friends that want to be with me. If I’ve “scheduled” a few too many hangouts on the weekends, I’ll crash and shut it all out/find some excuse and lie about why I can’t be there. I’ll shut myself off.

7. Sensitivity. If someone is upset with me, even for a small issue, I will become a mess of tears the moment I’m alone. It will sometimes cause me to spiral, making me feel suicidal, worthless, etc.

8. Irritability—my nemesis. I don’t know why I do this, but I’ll dip into periods of being so irritable that I don’t feel like talking or interacting with anyone unless I absolutely adore them (even then, I’ll struggle to not be irritable.) The moment someone tries interacting with me, I’ll be very curt with them. And later, when I’m alone, I’ll be angry at myself for reacting that way, unsure why I couldn’t just talk to them. It just feels like…almost like another moment of speaking was an effort I couldn’t give, and the fact that they’d talk to me and ask me to give that effort irritated me. I’ve learned to be more aware and communicate when I’m feeling this way. I’d convinced myself for a long time that I was just an unkind, uncaring person. But that’s not true, and sometimes I care so much that I would throw all of my things to the wind if it meant I could make someone’s day.

9. Traumatic childhood (abuse and neglect).

10. Show transitions between feeling so empathetic towards people—truly understanding them at their core as a human being and loving them with all of my soul—then feeling so numb that I wouldn’t care for a single person or thing in the world, including myself. Then again, there are times where I have this insane, almost narcissistic feeling in my chest—that everyone around me is blind to what it really means to be alive, that the world is meant for more than this and I’m the only one that can see it.

11. Hobbies. Oh boy. Researching and learning, spending an entire week—I’m talking 3am, soaking in all the knowledge I can until my body cannot stay awake for another second. I’ll want to stay there all night, feel unstoppable and like THIS IS IT. This is the thing I’ve been searching for—this is what I love to do. (Despite only trying it for the first time a few days ago.) Then a few days LATER, dropped. Gone. Why? Because suddenly there’s this grossness in my chest with it—it’s too much work, I can’t do it, my head’s so cloudy, I have too much going on already. Oh, what’s that??? Sewing? Hecks yea! I can do that. In fact, I’ll be the best you’ve ever seen. Then, dropped. They do stick sometimes. I love drawing, but I’ll have a week or two of avoiding it before eventually returning because I finally enjoy it again/have the life back in me.

12. Personality. I don’t even know who I am anymore. It feels like I cling to whatever I need to, what will get me through that day. Feeling “on top of the world” makes me feel normal, while lows make me feel like I shouldn’t even be here because my mind is at odds with everyone else’s.

13. Ahh. Recklessness. Because who doesn’t love putting their life in danger for the thrill? Sarcasm aside, it’s serious. Though my reckless tendencies can lead me into a genuinely dangerous situation, it will feel as if I can handle anything. Like I’m invincible. But this recklessness isn’t always life-threatening. Sometimes it’s just really, really poor decisions. Like previously said—money spending, trusting strangers, calling out of work, spontaneous ideas that, in actuality, take a lot more planning than my brain convinces me I need, etc.

14.  Racing thoughts. These overwhelm me a lot. I’ve heard of racing thoughts with Bipolar Disorder, but I’m not sure if mine is the same. Regardless, I’ll say it anyway. Racing thoughts of future decisions I’ll have to make, of idea I want to try—basically I’ll make an entire plan (or my version of a plan) in my head and then forget it. So many ideas, so many possibilities, or just the most random stuff that I can’t control. These racing thoughts usually only get severe when I’m in a really good mood, or a really, really bad mood. Especially when I’m struggling to sleep (which happens often) because I can’t for the life of me STOP. Just s t o p thinking. But no, my million-dollar plan must be done at that very moment. The only time I’ll stop is when I’m utterly exhausted and my brain finally agrees with me, that nothing will get done unless I can sleep. T h e n, and only then, when I’m on the edge of collapsing, will I finally sleep.

15. Self-sabotage. Probably the one I hate, and fight, the most. There are sometimes when I’m extremely low, or overwhelmed, and I’ll consider throwing it all away. Not life, but everything I’ve built in it. Breaking up with my boyfriend, cutting ties with my friends, quitting my job. Disappearing because life is too much. Sometimes I’ll even make plans to do it, or those plans will just lead to me cancelling a few hang-outs with friends or taking a day to myself to let the overwhelming feelings out of me. Then a week goes by, and I’ve never loved those people more.

Life is a rollercoaster for me. Sometimes, I’ll be begging to get off, and other times, I’m screaming with joy at the top of my lungs.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iidcrr/i_think_i_might_have_bipolar_2/,mollyandthebody,1738771319.0,mentalillness

2235,Can someone guide me?,"

Hi my fellow redditors. I bit the bullet finally and finally decided to a psychiatrist. I'm 27M and I have been feeling a bit off due to a lot of things happening back home. My mother has a history of mental health issues. 
So when I visited the doctor I told him about my symptoms,  family history, general well being etc. This is the first time I'm seeing a psychiatrist by myself so I didn't know what to ask etc so I just told him what I was feeling. If anyone has used his consultation services and found helpful please let me know. The clinic's name is Curatus Mindcare clinic, iit market. 

He has prescribed me lithosun and newcita. I googled lithosun and it's prescribed for bipolar disorder (my mother suffers from it). Right now I'm a bit scared of getting into medication and kind of thinking whether I should get a second opinon or not. 

If there are counsellors or psychiatrists here in this sub, their inputs are welcome. If someone has visited him previously also please let me know. ",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iib4e5/can_someone_guide_me/,,1738765574.0,mentalillness
2236,Schizophrenia bipolar type,"Been dealing with my mother for 10+ years diagnosed with this illness. I don't know where to start, I don't know what to say. I need help and don't even know how to ask for it. I have hospitalized her MULTIPLE times in recent years, she gets off the petition and quits taking meds and we end up in the same cycle every year. Her delusions are BAD. She's not open to talking about them. She believes them to the fullest extent. She doesn't trust anyone. I've resorted to naturalpath doctors because I can't put her through hospitalizations again. Every time I petition the hospital to come get her, she confides in me less and less to the point where I can't help because she won't talk to me. I fear I've ruined a barrier of trust because of all of the times I've called the psych ward on her. I did it out of love & trying to help her get better because she won't voluntarily get medical help. Currently we're seeking deficiencies in blood work & hopefully a diet change will help symptoms, however I am also aware that this approach may not work. This illness is extreme & I'm at a loss. There is so much more to tell but if anyone has questions or advice I'll tell it there.

2239,Still depressed…,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1, ADHD, Depression, Anxiety disorder, and PTSD about 6 months ago. I’ve been taking my meds and going to therapy, but in all honesty I still feel depressed.

It used to be other things out of my control that would trigger anything that I was diagnosed with, or something with within my control that I had to learn how to manage. 
Now I’m just depressed by the maintenance it takes to put me in a place that’s somewhat normal. It’s the remembering to take the medication, going to appointments and follow ups, remembering what I can and can’t eat/drink, what situations could trigger me, understanding why I do things the way I do them, differentiating what is a valid feeling and what’s not, and I’m doing all this with no support.

My “friends” don’t hate me but dislike the person I’ve become, and it’s only because (as I’m figuring out) they only liked me when I was having manic episodes and being reckless. It’s hit me harder when they’ve made comments such as “we’re not getting the fun version of you tonight”, “not drinking at all? That’s not like you”, and “you need to have another manic episode”.

Obviously, I’m just exhausted from having to over explain myself while juggling everything else. Anyone else feel this way?",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ii3j8n/still_depressed/,Sad_Parking_6670,1738735490.0,mentalillness
2240,My best friends sabotaged my play I’m putting on because I’m “too mentally ill”,"I (17F) recently had a suicide attempt that was pretty big news because when I didn’t return home I was reported missing. After I came home I was in bed depressed and not doing anything for a week but I’m now going back into society. 

I’ve decided to keep myself busy by putting on my first ever production of my play I’ve written, it’s not dark or inappropriate. It won’t be a big scale production, just something I want to do with friends. I messaged my drama group chat asking if anyone wanted to join, and I’ll split the profits equally between the cast and I, but the exact amount depends on ticket sales. The play is ensemble based, so I only need a minimum of 4 people but I can have more than that.

A lot of people responded, and I set a date, rehearsals, had the venue booked and then put up tickets. My 3 best friends I’ll call Amber, Ruby, and Jade are in the group. Amber was the only one to agree to do it, but I didn’t think much of it and 7 others signed up anyway. I made a separate group for the cast, but someone asked a question about the play on the drama group by mistake. Ruby responded seemingly waiting for someone to bring up the play so she could say this and it not be out of the blue saying “This is so rushed. Why are you selling tickets for a show you’ve only show cast?” I explained I hadn’t rushed it, and I just wanted to get the tickets out asap so I could advertise it and people had plenty of time and notice to get their tickets. Jade then joined in, saying it was a bad idea, especially since I can’t promise the cast would get paid.

I said it wasn’t a bad idea and that tickets were already being sold, so the cast was set to make money already. They said okay, and I thought that was the end of it. But then a few hours later two cast members messaged me saying they were dropping out. I found it odd, but accepted it. Amber later told me Ruby and Jade had been messaging the cast to tell them to quit because they didn’t think I was in the right headspace to be putting on the play and even suggested I’d keep all the money for myself because I have substance issues which is absurd. 

Are only non suicidal and people who don’t have substance issues allowed to put on plays like?  I never once brung up my mental health when talking about the play. I don’t know why they are trying to get people not to do it under the grounds of me being mentally ill?? Luckily the others are very excited about the play and one of them even asked if she could make the costumes because she’s loves making clothes. And they’ve all been coming up with ideas for the play and think it’s good. I’m happy the others like the play but I’m still so angry that my BEST FRIENDS would try to ruin this for me. I haven’t confronted them. I don’t think I will.

Amber is upset with Ruby and Jade too. She said that she thinks the play will be really good for me mentally since I have something to work towards. I’m glad she’s at least there for me. But I don’t understand why Ruby and Jade would do this to me. Both of them haven’t spoken to me since whereas before we were speaking daily.

I noticed how he took photos of cars and scooters because they were suspicious to him. He had anger outburst and most of the time it felt like he is not the same brother I have.  My mom convinced him to go to the doctor and he went to 2 of them who told him that he might have early stages of schizo but he only took the medicine while he was here and a week later went back abroad and stopped taking them . He had failed his semesters which was very unlikely because he was always on the honors list for each year and had done great internships and earned quite a lot during his college years. Now it's 2025 , and he called my dad with a violent outburst and told him to book his ticket back home as he couldn't sleep anymore there .

He recently had a police case in his university where he supposedly gave voilent death threats to the staff there.W e lost out mom back in may of 2024 and it was a huge loss for him as he was really close to her and only listened to her

Now that he is back home , things are worse to a point we are considering involuntary addmissionHe goes out of the house for hours and doesn't leave his room when he is at home . Smokes around 14-15 cigarettes each day and we suspect he takes drugs too . He talks to himself and laughs to himself a lot . accuses my dad of trying to control him or keep him at home. He talks about suggesting a genocide of certain group of people and laughs about it but is quite serious . He talks about government conspiracies and how they are trying to control everything and everyone . I have started to fear him a lot and its not my brother He refuses to get any help as he thinks nothing is wrong with him But things are hard

2263,Am i normal or just mad?,"Its really hard to write it in title, but what i essential mean is as follows.
I don't know if its ok or not but i cant feel things normally.for eg if i am just getting to miss someone so say i will cry for a second and in the next second i am thinking about the social issues of animal shelters. I don't know where my brain takes me in a split second. Its just wanders a lot, a lot without my permission. Other times i just feel blank, neither Happy nor sad or any other emotions. Just blank.. no thoughts. Its even like i can't feel my body for days or months. I really don't feel anything, like i don't know whats life..for me it's just things passing by in flashcards. I forgot things quite often and i am very clumsy.
I have trouble remembering past things like say my childhood , because as i said i never felt anything, so for me it feels like i am making some story and it never happened to me . I usually get in the struggle between whatever i am telling is true or not .
If that wasn't enough my dreams , man they are so vivid , and so troubling that i get tired when i wake up and can't stop thinking about them, infact i feel more feelings in Sleep than  in real life. 
I struggle to indentify my feelings a lot, sometimes i tell myself to feel certain way as its the appropriate way, not because i  feel that.
And when i get angry man, imagine a lunatic person twisting and turning his arms and rubbing his body parts furiously and plucking out his hairs and then beating himself. Thats me , i hit myself a lot.
I usually get stuck, like i want to communicate to people by speaking up but words don't come out of mouth. And even if they do, i can clearly feel what i say and my facial expressions doesn't match. For most of the time its just no emotional expression on face .
What the hell is wrong with me?? I want to live life like other people, and not just die without feeling anything.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ihllwk/am_i_normal_or_just_mad/,Far_Load8372,1738686415.0,mentalillness

2265,I cant take it anymore,"hello. I, 16 F need help. I don't know what to do, who to see, or what to say. I'll try and explain this to the best of my abilities. 

• context •
I am not diagnosed with any mental or physical conditions related to any of the following besides anxiety, OCD is also a possibility but never a confirmed diagnosis. I was prescribed hydroxyzine to try and get me to sleep, it works but sleep is barely the problem here. Starting back in 2020 I began therapy and stuck with it until 2023. I moved in May of 2024 and honestly I haven't noticed change with my problem over that course of time. 

Okay let's get into it,

I find myself distracted during the day, usually it's bearable and I can achieve everyday tasks but sometimes it's worse than others. I find myself zoning out often, I'll get random dark racing thoughts while I zone out and then randomly i'll click back into reality like nothing happened. It's bothersome and scary. When I zone out I have extremely vivid and scary visuals and there's been times where i've put myself into panic attacks because of the extremity. I often hear ringing in my ears, no voices or anything like that. I am a normal teenage girl, I do well in school, I have many friends, a decent home life and a cute dog. I need help. This is plaguing my life and I find myself lost in this, whatever it is. I was always told i have an overactive imagination, which is probably true. I don't have nightmares while I sleep but it's like I have nightmares during the day while i'm awake. I don't religiously watch scary things or surround myself with negativity. I just need help, I'm so tired, I feel crazy, I can't take this anymore.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ihcqj3/i_cant_take_it_anymore/,Outrageous_Age_7640,1738655834.0,mentalillness

I just want to go to sleep. The moments where I can feel myself relax enough to start drifting into sleep is probably the only break I get from feeling this way.

2268,At my WITS END trying to find the right med combo,"sorry in advance if this is rambly/incoherent, i am exhausted and feeling very lost and helpless.

I (born F, 29) desperately need advice re: medication and brain alphabet soup. I've been officially diagnosed with depression, GAD, OCD, CPTSD, BPD, and my biggest opp(osition), ADHD (specifically the fucking insomnia), which i was diagnosed with when i was like, 3/4/5, very young. i know there's new terminology now but i always remember my doctor telling me i was very present on both ends of the ADHD 'spectrum', and that i was also one of the worst cases he'd ever seen :') i have pretty significant medication trauma from being made to take meds from a young age against my will, along with the high dosages making me feel unlike myself. however I've been trying to work past that now in adulthood as i know medication is the most likely route to a more harmonious mind (i have done therapy and have a desire to continue it but i have moved and have yet to find a therapist covered by my insurance that has experience with my various issues and how they all interact). however, the medication i used to take a couple years ago doesn't seem to be working anymore and i am losing my mind a little bit. i would love any advice, recommendations, etc before my next appointment with my psychiatrist later this week. 
currently I'm on 37.5mg Venlafaxine, once daily, 120mg Lithium Orotate once daily, 50mg Hydroxizine once at bedtime, and 10mg Melatonin once at bedtime. Yet here i am, pushing three hours after I took my sleep meds, wide awake and nearly shaking with a weird, on edge feeling I can't shake. I have recently tried Clonidine (hit max dosage, didn't put me to sleep) and Guanfacine (again, didn't put me to sleep). And previously have also tried trazodone, which put me to sleep but gave me horrible headaches, and was immediately discontinued, and seroquel, which to be honest I don't remember how it did. Hydroxizine when used a number of years ago also put me to sleep quickly and easily but no longer seems to do the trick. I soend all of my waking hours feeling constantly somehow both on edge and completely disconnected, which i think could mean i need an increase in my Venlafaxine. I can't sleep at night, end up unintentionally crashing during daylight hours to get the bulk of my sleep (and no, daytime sleeping isn't stopping me from sleeping at night, when I make sure to stay awake all day i still can't sleep at night plus i get the added fun of feeling even more unhinged and delirious, so I'll take what little daytime sleep i can to at least keep me feeling a little sane), still feel fatigued during all waking hours, and still only manage 
to scrape up around 4-6 hours total. I've learned through trial and error in the past that around 10 hours is where i feel at my best and most capable, and anything 3hrs or less feels like i didn't sleep at all. If anyone has aby suggestions or ideas for a miracle sleep med that will knock me out for 10 hours I am begging that you please share, I'm willing to change my entire medication line up if there's interactions, I'll find other depression/anxiety meds if it means I'm actually sleeping well.

I want to introduce myself a little more before I start with my story. As I said I’m 18 years old at this moment. I’m close to being 19. It’s been a stretch haha. I am a shy but really charming person, like I want to be there for people I’m studying to be a nurse right now. Outside of that I like to write poems and I’m a boxer.  I would like to think people like me for who I am becoming but till than I’m happy with who I’m becoming.

Before you read this I would recommend that you listen to piano or Elijah Fox. I write poems to express my feelings and usually do it with his music.

My Story:

I used to live in Italy when I was younger when I was a toddler we moved to another European country because my mom and biological dad divorced. When we moved to the other country it was the one my favorite grandma lived. I was happy to say the least she was the best thing that ever happened to me because I really loved her. I only spoke Italian when I came here, but picked up English right away and after English I picked up the main language in the country. I tried to go outside and make friends but I was scared because where I grew up in Italy there were a-lot of bodies of sadly humans. So I was pretty scared to go outside after two years of living in the main city of my new country I moved to a suburb not to far away from it. I felt saver, my mom met someone new and I love my dad even tho he isn’t blood. At that time it was hard to call someone that’s wasn’t my father dad. I started to make friends and got bullied a lot in the neighborhood because of the rabbit teeth I had. When middle school ended I was 12-13 years old and build a lot of hate for people in general because of the bullying. My grandma got really sick and passed away due to a sickness. I didn’t really know how to grief, my parents are workaholics and never were around as much as I wished they would be when I was little. I had to understand why I felt hatred and anger towards myself and everyone. My grandma was the only one that was always there for me, from when I didn’t understand why I was the one to get bullied or beaten by children my age. After she died my flame died with her. The same cold, the same emptiness, the same weight, the day she left, the day everything stopped, the day that warmth became a memory. It broke me, I didn’t have anyone that truly cared about me anymore. I was full of hate and was always on the same bench in the park where I walked and sat with my grandma. One day some by the name Oscar(fake name) came to me and asked me what was wrong because he saw the hate I carried. I told him what happened he asked me if I valued my life and I disagreed. He asked me if I wanted to become successful for my grandma and asked me to work for his group. I stupidly accepted his offer. His group was a drugs trafficking group so I transferred drugs from point A to B because kids never got checked. This happened 2 months after my grandma passed. When I turned 14 they asked me about the cuts I have on my back. I blamed them on me growing to quick but he knew it was because of the kids that bullied me. He wanted to train me to become a weapon. I simply accepted his offer because I stopped valuing life a long time ago. When I turned 15 I was turned into a monster that knew how to kill and sadly had too. I was thought how to torture people and had to get information from them. The things I did are unbelievable brutal. When I look at my hands all I see is blood, anytime I see myself in the mirror I see that old self covered in blood without a care in the world. the year I turned 16 something changed in me I didn’t want to hurt people anymore but still had to. The group that I worked with understood what I wanted and said I still had to repay them and I did with the money I earned throughout the years I was full of hate and anger the entire time I wrote poems like these.

-

Beneath my skin, the hatred swells, a furnace born of private hells. They made me their blade, their merciless hand, molded by violence, shaped by command. They whispered lies, they carved my soul, turned me to ash, left me unwhole. I was their weapon, their killing breath, a servant bound to deal out death. But their faces, their faces won’t leave, the ones I struck, the ones who grieve. Eyes wide with fear, mouths torn in cries, their shadows linger, their blood never dries. I see them in dreams, awake in the dark, their ghosts surround me, leave their mark. No water can cleanse, no prayer can mend, the lives I’ve broken, the wounds that won’t end. They built this hate, they forged my wrath, led me blindly down their crimson path. But every step, the weight remains, a crushing tide of silent pains. I want to burn them, tear them apart, those who shattered my soul, hardened my heart. Yet the blood I’ve spilled still stains my hands, and I can’t escape the weight where I stand. The fire inside, it sears, it screams, but vengeance won’t silence these endless dreams. I carry the dead, their cries, their loss, and the blood, oh the blood, it never washes off
-

They forged me young, shaped my hands into steel, tore out my softness, taught me not to feel, they hollowed me out, replaced hope with fire, built a weapon of vengeance, fueled by their ire. I don’t remember what love ever meant, if it was real, it was fleeting, already spent, my chest is a void, gnawing, immense, an endless ache, sharp and intense. But anger, oh anger, it’s all that I know, it burns in my blood, it demands to grow, this world that betrayed me, that dares to exist, I’ll tear it apart, I’ll crush it to mist. I see their faces, smug and unaware, the ones who’ve ruined, the ones who don’t care, they built this chaos, this venomous lie, and I’ll burn it down, I won’t ask why. The trees can wither, the rivers can rot, I’ll smother the earth, leave no untouched spot, its beauty means nothing, its worth is a trick, it fed me poison, and made me sick. For them, I’d destroy it, rip it in two, I’d blacken the heavens, blot out the blue, I’d crush every stone, every sky-high spire, until there’s nothing left but my unholy fire. Even now, as I rage, the void pulls me in, a cold, hollow whisper beneath my skin, I’ve killed what I’ve touched, left ruin behind, a cursed creation, vengeful and blind. I don’t want to save it, I don’t want to try, I’d rather see everything wither and die, but still, in my chest, the ache claws deep, a desperate hunger that won’t let me sleep. I scream at the heavens, but they never reply, I dream of love, but my dreams are a lie, if I could feel, I’d still burn it away, vengeance consumes me, it’s all I obey. They built me for this, they wanted 
my hate, now I am their ruin, now I am their fate, I’ll tear down the world, I’ll leave nothing new, and in the ashes, I’ll ask, where were you?

I was lost in anger and sorrow when I enrolled in nursing school. I tried to change but didn’t seem to have the will. To change the revenge of them making me their weapon, and using me to keep their hands clean. I don’t want to go into to much detail because I think I’m not ready to share it all yet. I was full of hatred and sorrow I didn’t want to live anymore. I attempted and with every attempt I failed and spiraled further into despair. When I was 17 I was doing a little better I started boxing to try to keep myself busy. A close friend of mine had attempted a couple times aswell, she’s happily still here. When I became 18 I started to become more open minded because I started to really try to- understand my emotion in June everything changed one of my closest friends died. He was 17. I blamed myself I knew he wasn’t doing good but thought he would be fine. I could’ve prevented his death I keep telling myself, knowing I couldn’t have. I hated myself for it. Now I’m almost turning 19 and this year I’ve grown into my old self, the little energetic boy that loved people that wanted everyone to be happy. My friends ask me why I can write poems so well and it’s because I’m a deep thinker and always keep thinking and thinking, Sadly that works both ways in this case I’m becoming version I want my child to be and I’m grateful that I can. I think something just gave me a nudge after all these years of hating people that were fighting for the same reason I was. Revenge, revenge for no reason it’s ridiculous to hate someone for something that they did if it won’t end up changing them or make them believe what they disagree with. But in the end I’m truly a boy who yearns for the eternal peace of humanity. Even though my young soul yearns for the eternal peace of death. That’s what most people wanted a reason to keep going. Anything less is pointless, if it doesn’t exist I’ll make it happen I want people to live life without suffering. That is the sole reason for this. And sadly not everyone thrives to be the best version of themselves. Some borrow their selves into hate and revenge, some borrow themselves in sadness and sorrow, even tho not everyone makes it out they all will experience true happiness in their life even if it’s seeing their kid get born and be taken away by the police infront of their kid. That’s the best example I can give you from what I have experienced in my life. People are too busy asking themselves why did I do this or that but never how do I intend to live my life. And if that’s seeing your own kid be born I’m happy for Oscar that he managed to see it happen. I simply came to my senses. I want to show you (reader) that even I Cat can recover from the trauma I’ve inflicted and created on myself and others. I mean it when I say this. 

I apologize that I can’t go into more detail because I want to move on and believe anyone that is struggling with hate,sorrow, vengeance or lust will understand how I felt. 

I truly,truly believe you can make it. The amount of things I’ve seen what I’ve seen, what I’ve done to people. I mean it you CAN do this and you will.

I only wrote about the surface of what happened because I want you guys to see the progress and not what I’ve been through to inspire you.

If you have any questions I’m happy to answer them.

2274,"Stuck in a Loop for 6 Years: Procrastination, All-or-Nothing Mindset, and Fear of Change Holding Me Back","I'm 24M, and for the past six years, I feel like I've been stuck in a loop—doing the same things, not gaining new experiences, and watching everything around me move forward while I remain in the same place. I’ll give an overview of the patterns I’ve followed since my school days.

I was never a top ranker, nor a slow learner. I consistently scored 90+ in math and science because I found them interesting and challenging, but I struggled to get 70+ in language subjects. My study habits have always followed the same cycle: I plan to start studying weeks in advance, imagining that I’ll cover everything early and only revise before exams. But in reality, I always end up pulling an all-nighter, cramming at the last minute, and even studying right before entering the exam hall. Since school subjects were limited, this strategy worked, and I managed to secure above-average grades.

However, now as a full-time employee, I find this approach unsustainable. I know I’m capable of delivering more, but my tendency to procrastinate and work at the last minute only allows me to complete tasks on time—not to do my best work. I’ve noticed a recurring pattern in my life: I start a task or goal, stay consistent for some time, then drop it, only to restart later.

One thing I’ve realized is that I don’t struggle with concentration if a task is truly important and has a strict deadline. In such cases, I can focus for long hours until I complete it. However, when it comes to personal goals, I tend to procrastinate because deep down, I know that missing a deadline won’t have immediate consequences. If I’m accountable to someone, I complete things on time, but if it’s just for my self-improvement, I often put it off.

Looking back at my journals from my late teens, I was an enthusiastic and curious person. I loved questioning how things worked, staying updated on new technologies, and sharing what I learned with others. Some teachers appreciated this, but others humiliated me for asking ""silly"" questions. Even my friends mocked me, saying I talked too much but didn’t take action. Over time, I stopped learning new things and sharing knowledge altogether.

Another pattern I’ve noticed is my all-or-nothing mindset. If I get into something, I go to the extreme—whether it's gaming, fitness, or dieting. For example, if I play a game, I play it obsessively. The moment I realize it’s affecting other areas of my life, I quit completely. The same applies to dieting: when I’m on a diet, I strictly avoid sugar and junk food, eating perfectly balanced meals. But when I fall off, I binge on unhealthy food. I know that balance and consistency are key, but I struggle to maintain them.

Doom-scrolling is another major issue. I spend an average of 4 to 7 hours daily on Instagram. Despite being consistent in the gym for three years and avoiding smoking or drugs, my main struggle is following through with goals. This has led to insecurity, low confidence, an irregular sleep cycle, and difficulty saying no to things (though I’ve almost fixed that).

I also feel like I don’t belong in my current job, yet I remain in my comfort zone. I know I need to prepare for a job switch, but I struggle with consistency. I’m stuck with toxic managers and a work environment that drains me, yet I’m unable to take action.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ih5ds3/stuck_in_a_loop_for_6_years_procrastination/,sisyphus_happy3,1738630646.0,mentalillness

the closest to success of which was the most recent, it was early morning just as the sun was rising and i had been drinking in town with my bestfriend and idk what clicked but something hurt me more than it ever had before, i was in agony, an unbearable sense of pain i cant even describe. As i looked over the edge of the bridge i thought: ""this is it."" I was finally ready to do what i knew i had to for so long, the screaming and shouting of my bestfriend didnt bother me until before i went forward i took one last look at my bestfriend and the look on his face it scared me more than anything ever had before, and in that moment i knew, his pain was worse than mine.

idk what it would feel like to see someone you love die infront of you, he does hes already experienced that when he was younger with his mother dying of lets sat unnatural causes infront of him. As i looked at him through the snot and tears he yelped ""not again, just not you please."" In that moment i instantly stepped down and ran at him, i cradled him and held his hand and wiped his tears and all of a sudden my pain didnt matter to me any more, sure i could still feel the overwhelming pain flowing through my brain but i didnt care, not one bit. In that moment i only cared for him and how i could console him.

After that i felt numb for a while, i felt happy and relieved for once in my life. Seeing his horrified expression terrified me more than anything ever has before. I was truly scared straight. Even in my darkest moment i ignored my own pain and suffering for him and i dont regret it one bit.

But its still, now, an eternal struggle and every time i feel closer to wanting that relief again i think about how it would hurt him and it devours me whole. I feel as if im playing tug of war with my mind and almost that he is part of it. Regardless i love him, i love him more than anything in the world and if my eternal suffering means he can be happy then i suppose im gonna suffer for a hell of a lot longer.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ih53kx/choosing_between_your_own_pain_or_others/,PhilosopherRound1944,1738629853.0,mentalillness

2281,what would this be classed as?,"I have BPD and when i drink i can get quite upset, meaning i get upset everytime but nothing major i calm down each time. I drank a couple nights ago and it went so much worse then it usually does and i remember being upset but like my usual breakdowns, i don’t remember details i just remember being upset. this is from my partners pov: 

we walked into a venue and i got extremely upset by this (for some reason) and walked out. i was crying and screaming, talking about ‘god saving me’ and acting very erratic, flailing my arms around and being scared of everything. I do have an odd fear of God and religion as a whole more on the paranoia side which to this day i am still unsure of where it came from as i don’t have any religious trauma. I don’t want to go into too much detail but to put it lightly, my partner was scared for me. I was saying all sorts of things whilst he was trying to help me which don’t make sense and not sure whether it’d get taken down if i mentioned but my boyfriend has never hurt me in any way, but the fear i had of him that night i remember. i remember being fearful of everything, i was hearing things and this went on for a couple hours. This wasn’t a split though, I have been in therapy for years of my life and I know what a split is and it’s so different to what i experienced. I also remember being confused, about everything. I wanted to 💀 but i was ‘asking the lord to save me’. i was saying things and then saying the opposite. I was accusing my boyfriend of cheating, lying and random things that don’t make sense as it couldn’t have happened otherwise i would have seen it for myself..? But i was fully convinced these things had happened and i was heartbroken on how he could do this to me, which does happen to me sometimes but not to this level. When i tell you i was acting insane, i truly truly was and i didn’t recognise myself and Ive had some serious breakdowns/splits in my life. 

please ask for specifics if you think you can help tell me what this is classed as, because i think it would help as like i said it’s all very blurry. I can’t ask anyone I know because A, I don’t want to tell anyone hence why im posting anonymously on a reddit account and B, they wouldn’t know as nobody has cared enough to educate themselves about BPD.

2283,I didn't like it ans it's frustrating,"Hello
On January 31, I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist. I've had several sessions with my shrink and he told me last December that on January 31 it would be as I'd said before.
I was looking forward to this appointment, I was looking forward to finally having the words about what I was feeling. Some help. Explanations etc. But that wasn't it.
It's important to know that I'm hearing voices and so on. According to my research, it's akin to dissociation of identity. In short, I was feeling things and wanted to express myself. Because this disorder is not well.seen in society= possession etc.
The problem
Once I told the psychiatrist about it, it was as if: ""Tell them to go away, you're old enough to protect yourself, you don't need them anymore"" As if I had to get rid of them, when first of all I wanted to unburden myself, express myself, get answers to my questions! But nothing. It was as if I'd been forced to do an exercise I didn't see the point in.
She told me I had to tell them: ""I'm old enough, I can take care of myself..."". Which I did, but it sounded like ""Get out now, I don't need you anymore."" Except that I used to have a problem with communication - I ruined it myself because I was afraid of being an alter myself. I discovered that it varies etc. And there was a time when I couldn't recognize other people's desires. But now I think I've got nothing. Empty. And it's very frustrating

I don't want them to leave. We were getting along so well. I just want to get to know them, listen to them, find out what's new for me. This is really frustrating.... Please help me

2295,I can't be honest to my mom or therapist,"I had a pretty tough conversation with my mother about my mental health and other related issues. I started the conversation by telling her I don't appreciate her jumping to the worst possible conclusions when I casually say something. Like it's feeling very overdramatising (didn't say that tho cause I know she's just overwhelmed cause she's worried about me) and she replied that's because she can't trust me when I say everything is fine. She referred to the beginning of my mental and physical health issues. Where I denied knowing possible causes, therefore not confiding in her about some bad experiences I had. I said there was nothing going on and I would tell her if something was. I guess I lied. She gets that I didn't do it on purpose and that there are other things that might have stopped me from confiding in her. But in the end, she doesn't trust me anymore when I say everything is fine and nothings going on. I think she kinda is right. There are issues that I haven't told her. And issues I don't even dare telling my therapist in fear of it getting back to her. I'm afraid she'll react irrationally strong when I'm honest about actual issues, causing more harm then good. I've had therapists tell my mom stuff without my consent so I'm very afraid this will happen again even if it's technically illegal and punishable by law here. Also I feel like my therapist isn't always helpful but I'm having professional support with my mental health. I talked to my mom and she made sure to tell me she's proud of my progress and that she can see I'm handling myself better and she's just been stuck in the past as she hasn't worked through that herself. That made me feel slightly better but I don't think it did fix the problem because I still don't feel like I can be honest.

I said “so I can’t be in a relationship?” And she’s no “no she can you just can’t share that.”

It’s either I can’t be in a relationship or I can be but I have to bottle up those strong feelings and down play it to keep someone. This means who I really am can’t be in a relationship. She lectured me on this out of no where. She backhandedly said who I am can’t have that.

I’ve spoken to my doctor about these feelings and was advised to reach out to people close to me alongside professional treatment. I do feel having even just one person in my life who would care would be nice but I sadly don’t think I do.

None of them talk to me anymore and I don’t think they forgave me and I feel so sick I hurt them like that and I did the same thing to a 17 yr old who is now 18 I begged to them for explicit pictures and  making advances on text things like that and they said no and I kept doing it and one time they said I s@d them but I never met them in person before but I felt sick so I kept apologizing but they got annoyed and told me that they manipulated me to keep making THISE mistakes and begging for picture and that they were paid to but idk if that is true. 

But now I’m at school and I’m scared one of the people I hurt woukd report me or tell the whole school and I deserve it but I’m scared of being outlasted thought of as a sick monster and maybe I deserve it but I’m scared I’m scared what my new friends woukd think of me how they would never want to talk to me again how my teachers would hate me.

2305,How do I tell people I don't have bad intentions,"I have basically made myself a clown at school. I say/do things impulsivly, sometimes I say stupid/vulgar stuff randomly but semi-intentionally, I am very loud about most of the dumb stuff I do, and I act way to happy.

I have an idea of why I am impulsive since I have mixed ADHD and UMD,GAD,SAD,ASD. I think the ADHD mainly contributes to my impulsivly though.

I believe I say stupid/vulgar/loud stuff  to push people away.I was was bullied for the entirety of my middle school years kinda badly and had a few friends randomly turn on me due to this (I'm a freshman in highschool for a time reference) this slightly scared me from being attached to people.

 I'm kinda scared of friends leaving me the second someone says something bad about me now, because of the bullying, and a few other things. I have moved across the country since middle school though.

Since the move I have tried to ""rebrand"" myself for better or worse. I act aggressively happy now since when I was in middle school I was known for being so sentimental and crying over everything, people loved picking on me for that, so I kinda of over compensated.

Nowadays people talk about me all the time in school.I think they think I stupid, crazy and willing to do anything due to the previously mentioned behaviors so people at school probably could easily gossip about me. Recently I think my classmates have said I do more heinous things though, since gossip escalates from dumb to evil in my eyes. People do more aggressive things than usual twords me. I'm scared and I know I mean no harm but I think my classmates believe otherwise. 

How do I comicate a that I don't want to hurt people/ make them feel bad?

I already told them I'm not able to eat it and I already told them I can make my own food, but they insist on making this shit because my food has barely anything on it so it tastes bad to their immaculate and so important taste.
I have absolutely no pleasure in my life, as I also have severe depression, I'm not being able to do shit and my suicide attempt in December failed and now I don't know what to do to kill myself. I wish I had options other than sit looking at a wall and living off water and rice once a day for the rest of my useless long long life.

2307,"For those with a mood disorder or anything similar, how does your mood instability shows up?","I was talking to a friend who's borderline and we found it weird that their depression goes on for days without an end (like, they wake up depressed and go to sleep depressed every day), but my episodes are completely different: instead of stretching throughout days, weeks or months without stopping, my episodes have ""peaks"" around certain hours, usually in the evening around 6pm. Let's say I'm in a depressive episode (which I currently am), I'll be fine all day, but around 6pm I'll suddenly start feeling gloomy and s*icidal, I'll stop doing anything and isolate, thinking about how much of a useless person I am, etc. This will continue until I eventually fall asleep. BUT, and that's the weird part, when I wake up the next day, I'll be completely fine. No signs of depression whatsoever... until it's 6pm again and the cycle continues. I'll go back and forth between feeling alright and depressive for months. But sometimes, even though I don't have that ""depressive mood"", I still have trouble with specific things outside the ""depression hours"", like for example when I spent 10 months without having my hair and beard trimmed, which, according to my friends, made me look like a homeless person lol. I stopped going to university and failed every course, even lost my scholarship (which I'm now trying to get back).

My current diagnoses are: Schizoaffective Disorder type Bipolar and OCD, besides that, I'm under evaluation for a personality disorder (likely schizoid, narcissistic or a mix of both) and (C)PTSD. So that's not limited to my depression either, everything about me is that way, like (hypo)mania for example: I always found it weird that my manic episodes don't really impact my sleep schedule directly (although I've always had trouble with insomnia and sleep paralysis, but idk if that's related). It's just that I start getting energetic in the morning, then it stretches up until right before it's time to sleep, then all of that ""euphoria"" goes away, so I can sleep rather well, but just like it's the case with depression, the next day it repeats again. There were times I've experienced that for 2 or even 3 months in a row. Every day, I'd awake up feeling extra ""happy"", get euphoric, do some crazy things, only for it to go away at night, then I'd go to sleep and the cycle would repeat. The only time that was different was last year when I had a manic episode that lasted 2 weeks and during this time period I'd only sleep 2h a day and feel physically fine (although mentally exhausted).

Does anyone else experience their symptoms similarly? Any contribution to this discussion would be welcomed! Thanks in advance!

2317,I really feel lost and I want to feel like myself again,"To put it more simply to people who don’t want to read

 - Feel mopey, negative, and hopeless all the time for the past 5-6 months

 - Used to be super outgoing and friendly before

 - Anger and frustration are frequent and very sensitive to others being angry at me

 - See myself lower than everyone else

 - Find it difficult to care about things that are important like relationships with friends and family, work, and financials

 - Find it difficult to see humor in things not finding a lot of things funny like I used to

 - Almost feel emotionally numb

 - Often cringe at myself even when I am alone

 - Feel way too serious about how I see life

 - Try to one up people a lot too and talk about myself a lot which I feel stems from my low self-esteem and insecurities

 - Feel like I’m using my mental as an excuse to avoid doing my responsibilities making me feel like a total asshole.

 - Not sure if emotional numbness is something that people commonly experience but willing to power through if so.

 - How can I be myself if I don’t know what that is?

 - Hope to be able to feel emotions again other than anger, and hopelessness, whether it be sad or happy feelings.

For the past 5 or 6 months my mental has gone on a downward spiral and I feel like it keeps getting worse and worse as time goes on. There was a moment before those 5-6 months where I was in college when I felt truly happy with my life but right now, I feel really lost and hopeless with everything in life. I always feel negative and pessimistic and I get angry and frustrated really easily and get really sensitive towards people getting angry at me, however my low self-esteem and hopelessness prevent me from lashing out since I feel like it’s not worth it to show my emotions at all. I feel like I always saw myself worse or lower than everyone else around me which makes me really nervous interacting with people. I also find it difficult to feel and see the significance of or care about things that are important like relationships with friends and family, work, and financials something I was able to feel before. My relationships with my family and friends have gone down too as it is hard for me to build relationships and see the significance in them. It is hard for me to truly feel thankful about things when I should be. I find it difficult to see humor in things not finding a lot of things funny like I used to but there are occasions where I find things funny but at the same time it feels like I’m forcing those feelings. I often cringe at myself especially when I try to have fun even when I am alone. I almost feel way too serious about how I see life and I want to be able to relax and not be so serious all the time like I used to be before. I try to one up people a lot too and talk about myself a lot which I feel stems from my low self-esteem and insecurities. I almost feel emotionally numb as I haven’t felt true happiness or sadness in a while. I also get really anxious and awkward in social situations tensing up and not knowing what to say when I speak often telling myself that they think I’m really weird and awkward while also having a fear of embarrassment. I used to be really good in social settings but now it has completely gone the other way around. I have a history of being really anxious but now it has really affected my life. I have trouble concentrating and remembering things as well, often forgetting and focusing on my tasks and responsibilities as well as memories I used to cherish. I even have trouble concentrating on my own mental health and the issues and problems I feel like I’m facing.

But with all of these feelings I’m feeling, I also have this sense like I am being really immature and dramatic with the way I am reacting as well as being really mentally soft from this. There are so many other people who have it way worse than me and I have so many privileges that I should be grateful for however, I’m just stuck feeling this way. I want to feel better and be able to be friendly and outgoing even in stressful situations but its really hard for me to do that right now. I shouldn’t disregard and cut off from my friends and family just because I’m struggling and be myself but how can I do that if I don’t know what I like and with my emotional numbness. I feel like I am using my mental health as an excuse as well making me feel like a total asshole. Maybe I need to be more mentally tough.

Overall, I think my mind and logic are kind of in the right place, but my emotions and mind are not. I am really committed to getting better but nothing has really worked from exercise to mindfulness. If emotional numbness is common and something people are working through, I want to be able to do the same. But if it is not, I really want to be able to feel emotions again to not only improve my life but more importantly reconnect with my friends and family.

It's not only that I want to be happy, but I also hope to be able to feel emotions again other than anger, and hopelessness, whether it be sad or happy feelings.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ig1ohp/i_really_feel_lost_and_i_want_to_feel_like_myself/,Extra_Dig179,1738515461.0,mentalillness

2319,Partner and I are opposites.,"Hi,
I worry me and my husband are too different. He enjoys playing video games, talking to his friends online and likes the technical side of things in movies and music. 
I worry that he thinks I am someone I am not. I got mentally Ill as a teenager and that resulted in me not being as outgoing and extraverted as I was before. 
People who met me after my mental health declined see me as a shy,introvert kindof geek?
My husband says he first liked me because I watched anime. I wonder if he thought I was a home buddy geeky girl, nothing wrong with that btw! But the thing is I only watched anime and stayed hours on computers after I got ill because I enjoyed going down rabbit holes and scourering the internet as it was a type of drug to numb what was happening in my mental health decline,and I don't know if anime helped me or not but me going down rabbit holes in the depth of the internet really really is the worse habit of mine and is detrimental to my mental health.
I don't want to sound like I am whining but throughout our relationship my husband will gladly buy me anything to do with gaming, he made me a computer and bought me a VR headset and a switch, I am not a gamer though! I would prefer him to do something romantic for me like watch a silly film together without him talking the whole way through or buy me flowers.
I would like to see him do something just for me which puts him in an uncomfortable position like going to an art exhibition that he knows he thinks is unskilled and pretentious but listening to what I think of it anyway and not tell me how unskilled it is and how bad it is. 
I am proud of him for trying really hard, but are we just too different?
My husband likes, cats, cute anime girls, computer games and electronics and robotics, I really don't know anything about cats and though they are cute and I would like my own I would rather read the news then watch cat videos.
My illness connected me to my husband but I found we are so different it makes me stressed I am so lonely with my illness. I don't know if I can support him.I don't know if I am being paranoid and telling myself he doesn't love me but maybe I am hurting him and he would be happier with someone else.
 I don't know if I am just blaming him and I need to work with what I have, I want to be supported too.I get really down sometimes.

I even still have a stuffed animal named after something that's a reference to them.

But then I just started hating them, seemingly all of a sudden without a trigger. I hate seeing this character anywhere, I get mad when I do. Instead of comfort, all I feel is anger and disgust. I still relate to them, and I hate that I do. I dislike the entire show now mainly because of this character. I hate how popular it is, because I have to see it around me so much more.

Now, before anyone gets worried, I have never hurt another person. (Aside from my little brother when we were kids) However, I have put a few holes in walls. I hate it. I don't know how to stop it. I go to therapy, but it doesn't seam to work. On top of that, I also have what feels like 2 other imaginary personalities. I say imaginary because most of the time I feel like it's all made up, but then there are times where I don't feel like I am in control. And one of them has more female tendencies, even crossdresses. I am married, and my wife seams supportive, but I don't think she truly understands what I'm going through. I know she is bi-polar and has a couple of mental issues herself, but she seams to be just fine as long as she's on her medication. The meds I was prescribed kind of help, they keep me from having the random fits, but I still get pissed at some of the stupidest things, and if I forget my medicine I turn into a raging dick. I even got fired from my last job because of it. I have never been able to keep a job for more than a couple years, and lately not more than a few months. And now, I can't find anyone who will hire me, even fast food and Walmart has denied me... we just lost our house today, and I don't know how I'm going to get us another.

I always tell everyone around me that I'm fine because I don't want them to worry, but I am getting more and more suicidal thoughts by the day. What's worse is that I also know that if the right trigger hits, I could go the opposite and become homicidal. And that scares me. I don't know what to do. And I can't tell my therapist these issues because she will lock me up in a psych ward and I need to be around for my children as much as I can.

2324,Please help me. (This is long),"Okay so I didn’t know what to make for the title so this is where your going to have to read to know what I’m talking about. I think I have a mental illness(s) because I’m different from a lot of people in ways and I experience life differently. I am quite young but it bothers me everyday. I’ve also struggled with self harm for 4 years now I think. I’m doing better. 

Some background about my life is my mom was a drug addict and did drugs and alchohal while I was in the womb and I was born with AFS (alcohol fetal syndrome) my mom proceeded to have 7 kids including me. A lot of these siblings I have 0 contact with/ never see them. My mom has been apart of my life for a little while when I was around 1 but then I ended up living with my dad and my step mom and occasionally would visit her. She would get clean from drugs and we would have a good bond then she would go back to drugs and leave my life which I personally belive has given me really bad abandonment issues. 

(This is all like conjumbled together because I don’t wanna type it all and can be confusing but I can always answer questions)

Some of the things I experienced/experience that make me believe I may have some type of mental illnesse/s 

Whenever I’m sad I feel like it gets really bad to the point I think about using substances and feel drawn to use them even when I’ve never used hard drugs and have only used marijauna and nicotine. I feel like I need something harder and it’s currently happening to me right now . I stare at the bottle of Benadryl every day fighting to take some for getting high reasons.

Sometimes I get extremely happy and start making plans and get very motivated so start doing things and get a job and all this other stuff. 

Sometimes I even see things and I don’t even know if there real or not, In my room I have a window without any curtains and blinds on it and it goes straight into my backyard. A few times I see a silhouette of someone that looks like my dad at around 12-4am and I always ask my dad if he was outside during those times and he just gives me a weird look and says no. Whenever I try to tell my step mom or dad about this they shrug it off.

I’m also a VERY paranoid person. One time for example I thought I had cameras in my room like I was so convinced and paranoid that someone had cameras in here and I was inspecting my room and found a screw that kinda like looked like a camera from a distance and I started having a mental breakdown because I thought that it was a camera this whole time spying on me. A while back I wouldn’t even shower because I thought I had cameras on me in the bathroom which lead to me being dirty and making my hair wet to seem like I showered, then my mom asked me if I got my head wet instead of showering and it sent me into a panic mode because I swore she had cameras on me. (Gross of me I know) 

I’m bad in relationships, I used to purposely make my partner mad and get into arguments but when they would try to leave I would start having a whole mental breakdown. I don’t do that much anymore though.

If something tragic happens in my life I literally am crying for like 2 hours hysterically but then like 2 hours later I’m happy and laughing with my family and friends. 


That’s all I can think of but I’m sure there’s more. Some more background is that my mother has bipolar 1&2 and paranoia schizophrenia along with major anxiety and depression. My aunt and uncles on my moms side have major anxiety and depression and my grandpa had really bad schizophrenia. My brother /cousin?? aswell is in a mental hospital at I think he’s ages from 5-8 and he turned into a complete psychopath and he made his siblings eat his own feces and tortured them to the point he had to get put into foster care.

2325,"My manifesto, i guess","Hi and thank you for reading whoever you are, whether online post or some other way. This may sound grand, or fake, or made up, but these are my thoughts and ideas so far in my life. Who am i? why do my thoughts matter? well i don’t think they do much, but maybe someone will. maybe in my desperate attempt to call into the void and get a response will prove some success. Quickly to explain who i am, so this may make some better sense, i am 25 years old, male, American, and the only important thing at this moment is i do have schizophrenia, it is genetic and has plagued my family and now me. It is a mess or confusion, euphoria followed by a depression best described as dreadful and nuteral. Lastly i did endure what you call “childhood trauma.” only reason i speak of it like this is due to the current stigma around that term and the demographic that follows it and shouts it proudly. I despise those who make their life and whole person around pain and trauma. It is snake like. Nonetheless i will get into what this is, and explain more. This is what you could call a manifesto. This is no call to action, or cry for help. Simply i have a lot going through my head, ways i see life, philosophy, the over-all human expierence. to live is to suffer and to suffer is to live.. are the words i live by. Throughout my short 25 years on this floating rock in the abyss, i have learned and expierneced a great deal. More than i wish i had. Good things yes, bad things as well. now in my life im bitter, and intolerate of the world and people around me. i have goals and dreams, wants and desires, most not the same as many. however i feel in the base model of being i’m no different than anyone else walking this plane. I used to be social, and want friends, and to date and just be around people and life. Not anymore, i feel like a old man. wishing i could just sit in my house by the fire and read. or sit outside in a chair. i know for most may sound rather boring, but thats the point, you see? the calm, simple, peaceful stillness of ones body, all flowing as it should, breathe coming and out as natural as it can, the cool slight breeze against your face. This distant caw of some local bird. The sound of the leaves blowing by. The calm, the simple. I partied, did drugs, drank, still drink and smoke weed. lots of weed. Alas no herion or oxycodone or codiene or cocaine. Nothing fun anymore. Now things are dead, and grey. all the colour and life sucked out. This though brings a thought to mind, about life and it’s purpose. We all find meaning and purpose in life differently. some in love, and nurturment. others in crime and do ill to others. and for the wide full view many in between. my life before stopping the drug use, was not this way. simply was not. instead my life was more, cheerful, and with some certainty that i could do something with my life. After i stopped, it all was lost. I am dejected, in a constant state of i don’t know where. i wish i was here, present. not even my video games, my enjoyment, can i just focus. Lockin for squad but no, instead im drifting. My fathers constant bullying me, and i mean bullying as in im the small kid on ths school yard. He is nice and kind at times, then others controlling, and when he doesn’t get his way he gets angry and says terrible things, and sometimes tries fight me, used to hit my mom. For years this and how i was treated outside of home. People did not treat me well. And maybe rightfully so, as a kid and teen i was struggling with my mental illness. things were not easy. only by some grace i have some sanity, for sometime. My mom and dad constant fighting, and my dad picking on me, making out like a little no body. My mom on the other hand has been the best, can’t say really anything negative. now all this with the schizophrenia, and then drug use. Now i dont know what i am, or who i am. I don’t want to be here, alive. I wish i was dead. I’ve tried to kill myself before and have failed everytime. guess what, like i fail most everything. i cant even kill myself right. Alas im still here. “you’re strong” “oh what you’ve been through most people die” i wish i had. what life is this. I know what i need to do, i know what i want. but whats the point. to be met with constant and utter disapointment time and time again. What did i do to deserve this? who did i hurt, or offend? what god? ill never know. “Nate just do this and that and things will turn around” how? I understand certain things will change, but the things that matter, that hurt me. they just never go away? Well i have tried to fight it, and maybe im a coward. ill be king coward, lord of cowardess. i cant get over this feeling of abyss and gloom. I dont want to live, and as i do, id much rather have s woman, whom i love, and she loves me, i go through experiences, good and bad with her, grow a bond and love. is that too much? Ok second one is to be left alone. I dont want to go to family birthday parties, or to the concert, or the store. I want to be alone. Isolation. But i cant get it. i live with my mom, i dont live alone nor can i afford too. i cant be alone. Not only that my father still comes around, never escaping his destruction. “Oh nate be more kind, go find friends, be more social, get out of your room” these things are not ways i wish to live. I wish to live simple and alone, not bothering anyone, or getting in the way. But no. i cant have this. and what life do i have anyhow? 25 no diploma, working at a hotel living with my mom. good things going, i have a drivers liscence. yes obviously there are my own faults here, things i can and could have done. What do i do now though. it seems others would like me to think its easy, no it isn’t. I dont think i will live, nor be sane to long. Im gods joke, born without a heart beat 3 months late, without my father who still to this day hates me. Got schizophrenia due to genetics, only to have a step dad if you will, come and destroy my mother, me and now he’s sad and boo hoo. i hate em simple. my lifes a joke. Im a joke. so the grand question i have is. why cant i just die? understand i should have been dead a number of times. i was even dnr (do not resesetate) and they did anyways. Why. Why me?i feel as if my world is closing in. i feel as if im just hallow, cursed to be the destoryed person rendered by my father and genetics. im smart, decently high iq, so problem solving is good. sure im not the brightest, but i hold my own. i love philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, and the occult. i wish, i could just be surronded by these things, books, artifacts, etc. and studying. eternally gather knowledge. that would be true peace. but guess what, cant have that either. i have thought recently of killing myself again, but with fentanyl. sure fire way to do it, very potent, very toxic. But alas i dont know where to get any. so thats my 1 road block there. i want to die. because everything i have, could, would or should expiernece in life is over for me, im good man. save and quit please. I speed run this game but cmon lemme out. let me have peace. I wish i could have a wife, or even a chance with a woman, everyone says “You’re tall, blues eyes brown hair like girls dig tall duds” bulllllllshit. They look at me like im fucking dracula. not the romantic dark kind either, the holy shit run kind. I dont make friends well. i just sit in my room on the computer, or gaming. my dark ass room. Alone, execpt when my mother comes around. Really the point of me saying all of this is this, i hate everyone and myself because my pereception at this point only goes there. And it truly does.i try everything not to feel this way. When someone does something to slight me, or hurt me, i do think of killing them. not because “ i want them dead” no more, you made me mad and i want to inflict pain on you and kill you. i want to see the life leave your eyes. i want to be the last face you see. my dead, cold face. I watch gore and other mixtapes regularly for the thrill, and wish that i was the one doing it, and hurting people. believe it or not i dont like feeling this way. it bothers me, but also i like it. to me its enjoyable to hurt others in ways i deem worthy. sometimes i hurt someone unintentionally, i do feel bad. but if i intend to no, in fact i get a weird desire to do it again and more. oh i cut that dudes brakes and put sugar in gas tank. boom kitty, hyper, sweating, euphoria rush, and then. the thought will come.. why not set his house on fire, let him fucking burn, his kids, and find a spot near by to listen to them scream. i do realize these are not normal or “good” things to think. but i mean at this stage in my life, ive been selfless, thrown around, beaten and dragged. i just have nothing left for anyone. my wishes remain but i know now thats what they are. Wishes, dreams. nothing more. im not cut out to have a normal life, to be normal. so instead i want to hurt people. not in a serial killer way. No because id get caught. No no i want to get into politics, business, finance, serious positions of power and set hell upon every single last person, woman, child, father or son, i care not, you will be empty and dead like me. if anything in life, if i can just have anything, if it isn’t my family not trying to destory each other, or me getting out of this hell fog im in. than it is simple. i will have my life the way i want. So i will do what i can to hurt people. some small, little things, building to bigger and greater. shaking hands with snakes, and making deals with devils. i have nothing, i am nothing, and i will make other nothing. maybe even you. my occult studies and practices have given me some knowledge of a various things, that will aid in my hate quest if you will. I only wish to do 1 thing, and 1 thing only. hurt you. scare you. make starved. make you beren. give you promises of all and deliver nothing. i want to give you fire, and let its never ending hunger devour you. you a person no different than me, i hate you. know this, i will always hate you. i hate you for your flesh, bones, brain and organs, your personality, your dreams, your wants and desires, i hate it all but most of all i hate kayley fay jones, an ex of mine. Swear i have and will continue to do horrid things in the night to bend the will of her life to me, so i may destory her. this is all i have for now. this is again my thoughts and ideas. i need to vent this out. take what i say how you will, but dont think of me as a liar or not genuine. i mean everything.

2326,I feel as if I’m not real. Like I’m watching a movie about me.,"Context: I [21M]  have had depression my entire life. No SSRI I’ve been on has helped. (Sertraline, fluoxetine, and lexapro) It either makes me suicidal or really angry bordering homocidal. I treat it by smoking pot. (via bong) I have always been a heavy drinker, never felt the need to drink but still drank because it made me not as depressed.
When I drink, I never really feel it until I’m almost blacking out or puking.
I was diagnosed with migraines and stress headaches when I was 6 years old. I would get a migraine 3-4 times a week and I’d be out of school for it. When I get a migraine they are so bad that I throw up and have to sleep them off.
(Had ct scan and all that to try to find the cause. They found nothing other than a cyst in my sinuses) they cut the cyst out and my migraines became a little more manageable as in they’re not as frequent.

I also lost my health insurance (TN, USA)
Can’t work because I have Autoimmune myositis. (My immune system targets the muscles around my neck and back and they are kinda dissolving)
Can’t get back on insurance because I can’t work to pay for it. I’ve been kinda leeching of my mom for the past year. (I hate myself for it)

About 3 days ago I was drinking a 750ml bottle of vodka at around midnight playing Xbox. I was taking shots. Eventually around 6AM I realized I had finished the bottle and it was getting pretty late. I felt fine, felt a little tipsy. I laid down and as soon as I did that it felt like I was on a roller coaster. It felt like entire bed was moving with me. It started to make me a little nauseas so I just closed my eyes and went to sleep.

I wake up the next morning and I still felt super drunk. My vision wouldn’t focus, it felt like I wasn’t in my own body. Like I was just watching a movie of me. It made me super anxious. I decided to stop drinking but now when I smoke I start getting anxiety attacks.
Every waking moment since that night it’s felt like I’m not real. Everytime I look around It’s like I have motion blur. 

Yesterday I was making dinner and made my plate when almost instantly I started getting a migraine. I put my plate down and immediately went to get in the shower. After about 5 minutes of being in the shower due to this sudden and growing migraine my right eye went completely out of focus. Like it was fogged up. Then my nose started bleeding.

I don’t know what to do at this point. I feel stuck. I feel like I’m a waste.

Any advice or anything at all will help. I just need guidance.

TL;DR 21M with a lot of medical problems. I feel like I’m watching a movie about me. Like I’m not even real.

I think I have a disorder of sorts but I am confused. Here are some examples:

I change clothes like 5 times a day and am always unsatisfied 

If one thing goes imperfect with my day or my routines, I can’t focus and things feel off. I can’t be productive and it’s terrible.

I have mood swings where I think my self esteem is okay and then it plummets (no I don’t ever think I am grandeur)

I have to move around and change locations or else I feel restless.

If I don’t look a certain way (like my hair is perfect and I look clean and tidy) I can’t go out and struggle with my self perception.

2332,I'm dead or in a coma,"Good evening everyone, 

I've had a weird feeling for a few days. 

Last Friday I took the train, at one point during the journey I felt something strange, everything suddenly became silent as if everything had stopped. No one spoke anymore, the train no longer made any noise on the tracks, it was like muffled or paused. 
At that moment I was really worried, something was wrong, I looked at my hands reflexively to count my fingers and check that it wasn't a dream. 10 fingers, I wasn't dreaming. The rest of the trip passed and I moved on. 

But since then everything has been strange, but it's not because I'm trying to convince myself. Indeed, before thinking about it this evening, I had forgotten the train event. 
It's only now that I'm making a possible connection. 
Since last Friday I have a strange feeling that nothing is real, people act strangely, the routine changes strangely, there are sudden opportunities, there are coincidences, too many coincidences. I bring up a random subject and a few hours later a stranger will talk about it and have the SAME random discussion, on the same day, a few hours apart without knowing me or having heard me. I probably forget examples when writing, you will probably think I am crazy but I feel it. I feel like I died on that train last Friday, and nothing has been real since. 
I really think I'm going crazy, I'm not psychotic since I realize it but I'm becoming crazy. 
There are also weird things, people talk about unusual things just when I think about them. There are more and more coincidences. I tell myself that maybe I'm in a coma, but it freaks me out because it means I'm worrying my family in real life. I want this to stop.

I prefer to clarify that no I don't take drugs or alcohol, I know very well that from the outside it will be strange but I try to explain my feelings as best as possible but what's the point if all of that is false.",4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ifckxk/im_dead_or_in_a_coma/,Opening_Procedure959,1738433966.0,mentalillness
2333,Can you take a mood stabilizer and antidepressant?,"Title pretty much. I’m coming down from a medication induced manic episode possibly with some psychosis. I’ve been crashing so hard the last few weeks since stopping the meds that induced it. Last week my doc recommended a mood stabilizer (abilify) when i finally explained the manic episode, but she wanted to wait to see how things go without adding more meds.

Things are not going great, i just need this cloud of depression to leave and my antidepressants aren’t doing it for me so I’m ready to try it. But I’m scared because last time i went off my antidepressant i got extremely suicidal, which i already kinda am in this depressed period but i worry about what would happen.

2334,I'm scared to take my anxiety medication - how has it helped you?,"You could say I'm anxious about taking my anxiety medication which sounds silly but it's truly hindering my ability to take it. I used to be on a PRN of propanol and clozapam. I took them for a month and then stopped taking them. 

My doctor decided to put my on gabapentin mornings and evenings daily. I'm supposed to start today. 

The idea is it will help some of my generalized anxiety, my ARFID, and my cannabis use. Part of me is scared to heal as these behaviors caused by my diagnoses have kept me feeling safe for so long. 

Also I feel like being in a constant state of nervous system deregulation for so long, I'm scared of how it will be without being in freeze mode all the time. 

I guess what I'm looking for is some insight on my unrealistic thinking, words of advice, or stories of anxiety's medication.

2339,My life feels empty and unrewarding,"I have a personality disorder either bipolar or borderline, adhd, chronic depression, and severe anxiety. All of it sucks but what makes me struggle so much is spontaneous breakdowns and not being stable. 

I’ve been asked all my life “what’s wrong with me/why do I act like that?” From my own parents. My dad scolded my in front of my family over almost nothing. I rested my head on my hand in a restaurant and wasn’t chipper. I fall into unamused apathetic downs. He said I was acting like a child. It destroyed me and he tried to make up for it by saying over and over again “I love you” but I didn’t reciprocate it and he was annoyed and making it a scene and it was all his fault. My mom hasn’t known hat to do with me when I break down. I’ve collapsed outside screaming and crying about how my head will never change. I’ve been through so much medicine and none of it worked, my doctor told me my brain can’t change and basically all I can do is cope. 

I can’t keep relationships with it. My last relationship hurt especially bad. I warned them I was complicated and they said they’d stay no matter what. They didn’t. They got tired of me. I’m worried it’s only ever going to be that way. They were all I had but I was too much for them. I’m mad and sad and I wanna say they’re a loser but why stay with me? It’s just depressing. When I say I’m complicated I mean I have self esteem issues, all I wanna do is let myself go, and I think about how I can sabotage myself. They knew I didn’t wanna live. All that and I loved them. I want to love but I can’t be what I am. I had my good moments and those good moments are what I think of when I hear “you can work around your mental illness, you’re not defined by it.” I thought I could do it, but it’s all the same.

 I don’t have friends that are close. None are like me. None reach out to me. None of them are hardly my friends. I cared about them, but I only feel like I get forgotten about. 

Everything hurts. I don’t want to do anything anymore. I can’t do things I think I’ll enjoy. I sleep through the entire day and stay up at night. I don’t wanna eat anymore.

2340,how do i feel again?,"a few months ago, i think in september 2024, i just kinda stopped feeling anything. nothing traumatic happened in that time. but im devastated. i used to feel things really deeply when i was younger, i always felt deep empathy for others, i cried on animated scenes if a child dropped ice cream or their balloon flew away. i used to cry to sleep thinking that someone probably is suffering right now and i can't help them. or smile thinking someone is having a good time right now. i could yell at parents smoking in front of their children when i was a kid, i could make myself cry anytime just by thinking. and honestly idk i just felt things so deeply as if they were happening to me. after my best friend left me i got diagnosed with depression and they gave me meds called seronil (idk if that's what it's called in other countries but the substance is fluoxetine) and then everything just became grey. i stopped taking these meds after a while not telling my parents (they know about that now but they yell at me over that and don't support my decision), but my feelings never returned. i could literally see someone's life getting completely destroyed and wouldn't feel a thing. i'm sorry, i know it sounds edgy. i tried googling how to feel things again but it just said stuff like ""be kind be appreciating treat others like you want to be treated"". i want to feel, not pretend that i do. i used to wish i wasn't such a deep feeler but now i'd do anything for the emotions to come back. myself from the past would cry both writing and reading this, but now I don't. and I do have friends, people to talk to and stuff but talking about my feelings makes them even more distant in my head.
if that somehow explains this and helps finding a solution then im just gonna mention that i was physically and mentally abused when i was younger, from age 3 to 12, by my parents. they don't do that anymore, i think theyre just kinda controlling/spiteful now but maybe it's the old fashioned way they were raised in that causes them to act like this. please help me, i really don't want to be a zombie for the rest of my life",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ifa8am/how_do_i_feel_again/,pillsickbunny,1738427927.0,mentalillness
2341,"Anyone else never want to talk to anyone ever, but want friendships","I have this weird thing, since I was a small child. I don't talk. Like ever really, I was close to non/low verbal as a child and i was tested but I'm okay? Like if have some mental health issues but nothing that would really cause that that I know of. I definitely am bad at picking up on banter/jokes/sarcasm and find speaking to people and trying to make friends mentally exhausting and often not worth the trouble. Its awkward and feels very intimate. 

I have had very few friends throughout my life and most of them sort of adopted me like a stray cat and forced their way into my life. At first it was uncomfortable, but after a long time of them doing it, I'd finally be able to form a bond if they did it long enough. Which I appreciated. 

I currently have 1 friend at 28 years old because he did that. And while I do want romantic partners (as in that i am not aromantic or asexual) those were even harder to find. Thankfully Ive found my self in a pretty solid relationship but I'm mostly speaking about  friendships in general. 

I constantly find myself on the outside of social activities unsure of how to interact in those settings. It makes me really sad and reminds me of being 7 at the playground at school sitting by myself. Longing for connection but at the same time being too scared and exhausted by trying to figure out how conversations work and knowing it would overstimulate me for a very long time until that bond was able to form. I basically want friends but in my own way, I like solitude and having to consistently engage with them to keep them as a friend sounds awful because I very much go awol sometimes and people obviously don't like that for some reason, but I just don't *get* it

2345,"Advice needed (vent, existential dread post)","I’m posting this on a burner, because I don’t really ever want my girlfriend to find this and see how much I’m really struggling. My best friend in the world was my grandmother and she passed away several years ago now - she’s who I always went to for advice and she’s gone, so I’m turning to this Reddit now. I’ve never posted on Reddit before, so I hope I’m doing this right. 

I’m not really looking for a “see your therapist,” I’m looking for genuine perspective. This is also sort of a vent post, so if you don’t want to read that scroll on. I’m just kind of looking for help from people who are older than me and have lived to see more than I have. 

I think at this rate I’m giving myself heart problems due to the amount of stress I’ve put myself under, and I’m just kind of scared. I’d like to preface this (as I mention a few times later as well), by saying I’m not su*cidal and I am safe. I have mental health issues (anxiety, ADHD, autism) that are managed with a combination of therapy and medication. 


Some background: I’m 26, going on 27. I’m from the US. I have a relatively stable job that I’ve been at for about 4 years. In a few months I’m finally moving in with my partner of 3 years. I should be relatively happy, but I’m not. 

I’m in a constant feeling of existential dread, and I don’t really know what to do. People tell me not to watch the news, because it just scares me, but I feel like if I don’t, I won’t be informed, and that just scares me more. Everyday, I watch the president slowly close in on making our country more facist. It scares me so bad. I’ve tried to disconnect from politics, but it’s not something I can really do either. I feel like any day, everything is just going to close in on me, and my life is going to end - and that’s terrifying to me. 

I’m scared of the world ending. I’m scared we’re going to go to war. I’m scared of climate change. Should I run to Canada? I don’t feel safe. Even as I’m typing this my heart is racing. 

I’ve been in therapy for several months now and I’ve found some coping mechanisms that seem to work - but I always end up back here. At this rate, I’m going to end up with heart problems, or gray here, by the end of the year. I just feel so hopeless. 

I am trying to find the right words to describe how I’m feeling. Is this a midlife crisis at the age of 26? I lay awake at night, most nights, until 2-3am, in just pure anxiety. I feel like I’m dying soon. I know everyone is just going to say that it’s my anxiety, but I do feel that way. It’s something I can’t accept and that’s why I just keep going over and over it again in my head. 

Do I delete tiktok? Shut off the social media and world around me? Everyone says taking a break is what would be best for my mental health. But the idea of not knowing, is the idea of what scares me the most. I don’t know what comes after “the end.” I’ve been dreading it since I was a small kid. Maybe it’s a phobia? I don’t know. I don’t really know anything. 

I want to have kids with my girlfriend but I’m afraid they won’t have a good life because of climate change. There are people online who say the end times are coming, but there are still people who stay on the positives. I don’t know how I can trust either of them. 

I’m getting older, so are my parents. It’s terrifying. I can’t sleep at night knowing I’ll be without them and the idea of living away from them makes it even worse.

I’m terrified of moving to a state that people are saying won’t be there in a few years. I’m terrified even with the houses being built well, that we’ll end up de@d under the rubble there. 

I keep thinking I’m getting better but when I’m sitting here, typing this at 3am, I don’t really think I am. Nothing is getting better. I’m so tired of crying and living with this feeling of dread all the time. I feel like no one gets it and just blames my anxiety for everything. 

I can’t bring myself to find joy in anything, when it feels like I might not be here even a year from now, that I’ll be dead. 

I’m so insignificant. There’s only a few people that would even miss me if I’m gone. In the grand scheme of things, does it even matter? Is this floating rock going to even be here in 10 years? What’s the point of it all? Why even bother keeping going on when it’s all just going to end anyways?

I’m too scared to k!ll myself. I’m scared of the unknown. No matter how many studies or anything I read on it, it never makes me feel better. I’ve tried to educate myself with science or get into religion, but I haven’t been able to be religious since I was a child.

Is anyone even out there? Is someone watching out for us? 

If there is, why can’t they just let me stop feeling like this?

I look older, especially the last few months. I’m surprised I don’t have gray hairs. I probably will by the end of this year, honestly. I know I look older because of my mental health.

It just keeps getting worse, my mental health. This stuff is weighing on me so much I feel like I can’t breathe. I’m just waiting for the day I stress myself out to death, because that’s where it feels like all of this is going. Maybe then, when I’m de@d, I won’t feel so worried and panicked all the time. 

Like I said, I’m too scared of the unknown to actually k!ll myself, but I can’t help but feel like I’d finally have some sort of peace. 

I’m not su!cidal, just really really tired. 

A part of me thinks that I’ll d!e within the next year, and that I should start writing goodbye letters now. Not with the plan to end it myself, but planning for an inevitable end I see in my head. 

But really - would it even matter anyways? 

I want to show this to my girlfriend, to my parents, to anyone who will care - but would it even matter? Would knowing that I’m grappling with this when there’s nothing they can do really mean anything? 

I think I’m just beyond help at this point, and maybe I’d be better in an institution. At least there I’d be safe and looked after. Clearly I can’t look after myself, I can’t even keep my house clean. 

I don’t want to pay for an institution. 

Would it even matter if I’m so sure I’m going to d!e soon?

Does anything matter?

Do my words matter?
 
Do I matter?

I don’t. It’s just really really hard and tiring to accept that I’m nothing but a blip in the universe. 

And I’m just really really tired.

Writing out my thoughts was supposed to make me feel better, but it just made me cry more. 



I guess I’m just asking for advice at this point, to people who have lived through this. How do you find meaning? How do you cope with knowing that it could end any day? How do you live your life?

I could really use some advice, because I haven’t slept in a while because these thoughts are keeping me awake.

I might post this on a few other reddits for advice. I just really need help. Sorry if you see this more than once.

I would say that yeah every two or three days a week I get hit since I was small, basically for the slightest mistake, like not performing well at school. Every time my mom or dad hit me they would make sure that they blast music out loud in the house so that no one hears my screams and lock me inside a room. And I remembered the time when my dad asked me to undress before starting the hitting session. And when they were hitting me I was not allowed to cry, if I do cry the hitting would grow wilder and continue for a long time. This stopped when I was about 13 years old and I had actually forgotten about all of these memories since recently, and they keep hitting me like a truck(kinda like I day dream about those memories). My parents always had a thick wooden stick kinda thing with then all the time and my dad would use his belt, the side with the buckle obviously. And it's quite disturbing when these keep playing in my mind cuz I loved my parents so bad since I had forgotten all these memories, but now that i remember them I don't feel the same. When I confront them they always say that they wanted to make me a good child.

2352,I think my family relative wanted to unlive me,"So, he is my cousin, and he has been acting really weird lately. About a week ago, he came over and asked me to take him home (I have a car). Even though I didn’t want to, he kept asking the same question over and over until I agreed. We live in a small village, so walking home isn’t a big deal.

We got in the car, and the first weird thing was that he lit up a cigarette and seemed really stressed, which I just ignored. I wanted to take my usual route, but he insisted we take another road—one that was more isolated. I went along with it, but once we got to the deserted street, he took off his seatbelt. At that moment, I sped through the area as quickly as possible (the village is small, so it took about 30 seconds). Once we reached a more populated area, he started making strange hand gestures—there’s no other way to describe them.

Then, he suddenly changed his mind and told me to take him to his friend’s house. I just did what he asked, but barely two minutes after getting out, he was back in the car. This time, he asked if I wanted to drive to another, even more isolated village. That’s when I thought, *Screw this,* and firmly said no.

As we kept driving, he suggested again that we go to another remote village, but I refused. My family is just ignoring all of this like it’s no big deal. They don’t seem to care at all.

 Could this be some kind of mental illness? Or does he really want to…?

I’ve already reached out to my family physician and we’re very slowly working through more physical health concerns although he is well aware of the mental health concerns as well. 

There just isn’t enough time to focus on everything at the same time. I was hoping for some sort of online test to take to help narrow down my symptoms so I can suggest testing with my doctor to move toward a diagnoses professionally.

My biggest issue right now is I get EXTREMELY overwhelmed with simple life things. I can’t maintain input with friendships, work, family, marriage, personal health, food…etc I’m doing a lot of introspection to get to the bottom of why these things are hard for me. 

Typically in friendship I’ll disappear for months before someone hears from me and there’s a lot of anxiety around doing things for me - in order to get through it I have to plan for the worst to give me some sort of peace in order to move forward. 

Has anything worked for you and how did you narrow down what to test for with your doctor?

I (25M) have looked at and masturbated to shota (pornographic drawings of underage characters).

I didn't masturbate to it most of the time and i stopped last year when I saw a drawing of a baby and it disgusted me so much that I have completely stopped with it.

I have people in my head all questioning to do something like to get up and go to the bathroom or a stray bullet would come out of nowhere would hit me and it would be over.  
I can't feel emotions besides anger and happiness. I havent cried in near 2 years when it hits march. Its always random too. last thing is i feel the same if i get no sleep or if i take the sleep meds that my mom got me and pass out for 9 hours.  
I don't know if this is just some thing caused by me drinking a lot for the first time but yeah.

2367,Advice for a schizophrenic boyfriend,"A little background, for the past 6 months, my boyfriend has had an increase in paranoia, delusions and irrational behavior such as a spending spree, driving to DC in a rental and leaving it behind, ubering to and from DC, Philly, and a PA facility for mental health. He believes our apartment has hidden cameras, he believes he’s being watched, and recently he admitted he heard voices in his head. Crisis has been called on him twice, and the second time was because of everything that was just mentioned.

When crisis was called, he went into the ER crisis department, where they may have sedated him due to an outburst, where they transferred him to a behavioral facility. He stayed there for a week before go to a residential facility in MA and is currently there now. He has been there for 2 weeks, he’s on medication (he refuses to say what kind), and he says his diagnosis is that he’s normal. His conversations are generally with myself and his dad, and they started off good, where he admitted he needed help, he knew he needed medications, and appreciated the support. Recently, his anger has been off the charts, he wants to emphasize he’s single and that we aren’t together (we live together), he wants to know why we (myself, his dad and brother) all keep calling crisis on him when he’s “normal”, he doesn’t believe he went on a spending spree regardless of him acknowledging it prior, and is asking for a thc vape.

I did some research for thc and antipsychotics and it is not recommended for him to use recreational drugs or drink alcohol. He mentioned how other patients at his facility have them and now I’m concerned he’s vaping other patients vapes with thc while going through this process.

I am not familiar with schizophrenia, but I do think he might have some bipolar mixed in, and I’m not familiar with the medications, the phases to recovery, if this anger period is normal and/or will subside. The call I received last night with all his anger hurt me to a new extent considering I’ve taken off work countless days until crisis was called, paid for his car, got his rental and returned it when he left it on DC, took over all the bills, and am currently paying for his health insurance so he can continue this recovery process, even started his disability paperwork so he could receive some type of money so he’s not coming out broke. 

I have mad countless points to say I have no problem going to his facility to say what events led up to us calling crisis, however, he is refusing that because he believes everything myself, his dad or brother have to say, is a lie, again, regardless if I have proof.

I watched the man I fell in love with, a man who wanted to buy a house together, get married and have kids together, turn into someone who seems to hate me and think I’m an enemy. 

Any advice on what I can do, advice on what to expect, even supporting words would be really helpful.

So I just wanted to say that before I start telling yall this story. 

Mkay so I met this older guy in school, I am a freshman and he’s like a senior I think. It doesn’t really matter so… anyways we became friends, and to be honest I’ve had my eye out on him since September, so I planned out some stuff and he was my crush all along.

So one day I talked to him wtv and asked to be friends and we were for like a month, he was like my bsf, I told him everything about me. Like he knows all the embarrassing stuff I did which I think he’s nice enough to just stfu but well, god knows what’s going thru his stupid ahh.

And so basically we stopped being friends because he said I just complain too much and well okay idc. but istg I have to see him everyday and his existence just drives me crazy, like genuinely his existence triggers me, like whenever I see him I just automatically get mad, I usually find myself staring at him or daydreaming.

But anyways, it has escalated lately, like whenever i get like really really really tired, I start thinking / planning about actually ending him or ending myself so that he feels bad. And it’s the day after im like “what in the hell was I planning yesterday and why did I think so casually about it.” and like yeah.

I feel like if I don’t get help soon enough, I’ll just do something stupid.🥲 I need some advice.

I never really thought of them as children, I knew that that's what they were but it didn't click until last year when I was browsing a site and I saw hentai of a baby. It disgusted me and and then I realized that is what people see when they think of shota. I haven't looked for shota since.

I felt regret and realized that at the end of the day no real person was harmed because of it cause at the end of the day they are drawings. 2 days ago though I started getting extreme anxiety and felt such a deep disgust and regret and shame with what I had done. And I don't know what to do to make it stop, I felt sick to my stomach all day today. I have been shaking and honestly have been having a few suicidal thoughts.

At this treatment facility I go to they brought in a sound bath. At first, when it started, I was severely uncomfortable and felt like my brain was being invaded and I started feeling fear. As it went on the ringing got louder and louder and the fear progressed until I felt the noises were inside of me. I rapidly scratched my arm, I don’t know why, perhaps to calm down. After time progressed I felt my brain taken over by animalistic instincts and I bit down on my hand, I had an incessant urge to scream and growl. After a minute or so I bit down on my arm. By this point I had gone completely nonverbal and could only make animalistic grunts and screeches. After the sound bath person switched rooms I still could hear the ringing and I banged against my head as if to try and knock the sound out?? I don’t know what I was thinking in all honesty. It took me a while to get out of this state, but while I was in it I genuinely felt animalistic and like I was going insane.

I've literally no friends and I feel like I'm a terrible person because most of my friendships break up after a year or two and my sister keeps telling me it's not my fault but how is it the I'm the only person who has no friends but the people who fucked me over are doing completely fine. what if I'm the problem and people just keep lying to me to spare my feelings because how is this possible that I'm the one who always lose friends. maybe I'm a little too sensitive and like playing the victim all the time.

for context I had a friend grp in a levels but my so called best friend fucked me over(I had to skip a month of school because of retakes and during that time she got really close with a girl who would talk shit about me and would never take my side when I wasn't around and when I would confront her she would take the other girl's side instead so I dropped her) and due to which I lost that whole friend grp and then in the other friend grp this guy talked down to me and I realised he didn't respect me so I separated myself from that grp. after a levels I only had one friend from a levels due to all this shit and we stayed friends in uni. 

then in uni this one girl in my friend grp would constantly belittle me and make me feel like shit so I decided to distance myself from her and it all just went to shit(you can check my profile for the whole thing).

so now I'm completely friendless and it has got me thinking that something is wrong with me. now for context I've severe depression, anxiety and add (all professionally diagnosed when I was in middle school) and I used to be on prozac but I stopped taking it because it stopped working for me. so currently I'm not on meds and I feel like that's making things worse but I plan on goig to a psychiatrist soon. 

but still the main thing that's been bothering me is that I think I'm a horrible and unlikable person that's why people always fuck me up but in reality I'm the one whose at fault but I've such a huge victim complex that I make myself out to be a victim in every situation even if I'm not. I mean how much can I put on my mental health and at one point I've to admit maybe I'm the problem. 

has anyone else with mental health issues ever been though this and if so how do you tell what's your fault and what isn't? because I feel like the people around me are biased and lying to me.

TL;DR: I keep losing friends and feel like I’m the problem. I have depression, anxiety, and ADD, was on meds but stopped. Planning to see a psychiatrist, but I wonder if I have a victim complex. How do you tell what’s your fault vs. what’s not?

2390,How do you stay positive and hopeful when things just keep getting worse and more complicated as life goes on?,"Hi lovely people! Pretty much what's in the title.

I'm now 30 years old and I've had hope my entire life that things would get better as I age. I heard many adults saying that throughout my life and so I believed it.

Obviously, I've always known things weren't gonna get better magically and I would have to make some efforts.

Despite pushing through struggles at school, earning a diploma, and working in IT fueled by my passion for technology, life didn’t turn out as expected. In 2019-2020, I sought help for my anxiety, but years of trying and switching medications left me drained due to intense side effects. Instead of things improving, my anxiety and depression worsened, leaving me exhausted, demotivated, and struggling financially.

I've also started the process of an autism diagnosis, but I got overwhelmed after the first step and didn't even have the money anymore to continue the diagnosis, so I've paid 750$ for half an assessment for absolutely nothing, because without the second half of the process, it basically means nothing and I'm not even sure I want a diagnosis anymore after come things I've heard.

I'm tired of pretending I'm just catastrophizing because even if it's the case, then what??? Knowing i'm catastrophizing isn't stopping it. I can intellectually know something and still not be able to handle it.

But let's say I'm catastrophizing, now what??

2400,"I haven't seen my psychiatrist in a year, since I became pregnant, I'm worried they won't have me back as a patient","For about a year I would see the same psychiatrist monthly. I suffer from PTSD from work, and have debilitating panic attacks due to that, most of the time coming out of nowhere. 
I work a job that requires me to be able to be 100% capable at the drop of a hat, he understood this, as well as never questioning the validity of anything after hearing some of my experiences. 
The first time i seen him, I expected the run around of trying every antidepressant, when I'm not a depressed person. But he was understanding, respected me as an educated person, and put me on the meds I knew I needed. Yes, it was xanax, but it saved my life. 
Along with some other meds for sleep, I found life much more tolerable. 

After about a year, I became pregnant. I obviously couldn't keep taking the controlled substances I had been. I didn't think much about it, I just quickly self tapered with my last script and never went back, I never got a call from the office or anything. Pregnancy hormones did a beautiful thing for my mental health, which has now been on a gradual decline again since I stopped breastfeeding 3 months ago. I'm missing work, having trouble with daily life, ignoring responsibilities, and panic attacks are becoming a regular thing again. 

So I plan to call in the morning and I'm hoping he will have me back, and we can get me back on my med regimen. Normally I wouldn't think much of this, but looking at his recent Google reviews, it seems as though he's been dropping a lot of patients for non compliance.  No call/no shows, that sort of thing. So I'm concerned now, that he won't take me back as a patient, I honestly can't remember if I told the front desk staff or not when I left.  

Has this happened to anyone? Anyway to hopefully get my intentions and point across, that I was never trying to be non compliant, I just had a growing fetus to look out for and better mental health?

I'm worried if I try a completely different doctor, I won't get the meds that I know that I need and that work. I'll be forced to try multiple non controlled meds that I know don't work and have at times made me much worse. All I know is I need my fast acting anxiety medication back as soon as possible, I'm struggling way too much and I'm failing everyone in my life.

I'm with my girlfriend for more than 2 years, 35M and 27F.
We used to live together for most of the time, recently she's spending more time at her parents house. 
When we met, she was on some meds, like pregabalin, Clonazepam, sleeping pills and a lot of Marijuana. 
She used to get panic attack, from time to time, and have this general stress and anxiety. 
Few months into the relationship, she said that she want to decrease her consumption and I was very glad. Then she gave me the first flag :

1. You sure you can handle this? I can turn to a monster, and she laughed. 

At the same time, she told me that she quit with the Marijuana, and we were counting the days. It was almost 2 months without. After a year, within some argument, she gave me the 2d flag:

2. To be honest, I never quit the Marijuana like I told you last year, every time I got home to visit my family, I used to smoke over there. 

Few months ago she was very bad. Weird, impulsive, hot - cold.
She told me about one doctor she visited to do her general checkup. After some time, I saw the messages from him, and she saved his name with the word ""Lithium"" next to it. 3rd flag:

3. Doctor ""Lithium"", at the same time she was weird, got pimples on her face and diarrhea. 
In addition, she used to do a lot of checkup for her lungs, kidneys, heart. 

She getting depressed a lot, her family as well. They all kind of weirdo, crying a lot, not letting too many people get into their house. Like they are hiding something. They used to come to my house a lot, sometimes every weekend. 

Few weeks ago we had some big argument, and she called me a narcisist. I didn't know so well what's that, so I didn't my investigation. 

There's by any chance, she's having BPD / Bipolar / CPTSD? 

She has some patterns. 
She used to be drinking a lot of alcohol before, sometimes a bottle of wine in her bedroom by her self every night. We me she reduced it, but always wanted to drink.
Shes smocking a lot of Marijuana, and she told me clearly that she can't stop. In addition, cigarettes, tobacco, vape, oils. Everything.
She can't work. She can't even pass the first interview. She's always thinking what people will think about her. 
Sometimes she's super lazy, like in bed all day long, smoke and eat in bed. 

I'll be more than glad to hear some thoughts, and maybe some advices.

Like earlier today I saw an Instagram reel of someone talking about their abuse growing up and it made me lose my appetite and it was stuck in my head all day. And whenever I'd think about it, it would have the same effect. Brain fog, loss of appetite, and immense guilt. 
Part of this could stem from being told ""others have it worse"" as a child. My mother would spank me for crying, or something small, and then would go on to say ""other kids are abused by their parents"". Or if i didn't clean the kitchen right it was ""what would ____'s parents do?"" Or ""other children have to scrub their houses from top to bottom.""
She would even do this while I was recovering from anorexia, comparing me to holocaust victims and children in Africa who dont have food.

I have no one to talk to and when I try I’m ignored or am forced to agree that I’m fine. But I can’t get the help I want or need since I can’t leave my house do to personal reasons I’m not sure I can say here.

Every place I could go to for mental health in my area sucks ass and probably would make it feel worse, I just want to disappear of the map for who knows how long. I want somebody to hold and comfort me properly instead or me having to comfort them in the end and cry my problems by myself. I haven’t done anything physical to myself but I’ve hurt myself mentally in ways that are so unhealthy even though it’s the only way I can control what I want.

I hate I feel like my words are like buzzwords or white static to others, hate how I want something more but I feel so selfish to want something like an actual person to be there and to love me, treat me as I want to be treated. But I can’t get away from those who hurt me cause everyone I turn to just leads back to them.

I hate I’m getting so disgusted with myself just looking at myself in the mirror just feels alienating, that I can never feel right in my body and who I am as a person. 

That I never feel hungry or full and I just feel so numb to doing anything that involves food. Nothing feels right or good, I know no one’s against me but I don’t know what else to feel.

The only things keeping me here are shows I like and want to see more of or stories that are finished that I still want to read/listen too. It’s annoying how I don’t want to live for someone, That when I think of it it turns up blank since the only person I probably would stay here for moved away when I needed them most and i could stop them. I just want my downs to stop, I wish I could live in ignorant bliss some days and just be happy or feel something that isn’t just a “get though the day and you can sleep again” 

But I know it won’t change anything, I’m still just an ant to this world and my words matter nothing to most people. No matter how unique I can be or look I’m just words here, hoping for something good to come of it.

hello all, i just needed a place to kind of let some thoughts out. I have recently began taking some ""anti-depressants"", my doctor was so proud that this specific kind is also linked with weight loss as i am overweight....thats just extra info...back to my point...ive been in a mental state that has made me have suicidal thoughts and acted in self harm ever since i was about 12 years old, since then I have had random episodes of these intense down feelings where i self harm and kind of fall into a new ""me"" it sounds weird and i always feel crazy thinking about it, but its like there are different me's, and when these different personalities, (i will call them personalities for the sake of simplicity), take over i cannot remember the actions i make or things i say while they are in control, i harm myself in these personality switches, my thighs and upper arms covered with scars because i learned to hide them, when i am in this other personality, i can be ""trapped"" out of control either hours or days, the longest now having been a little over a week. the longer i get stuck in it the harder it is to get out and the closer i get to making a sever attempt on my life. when i am who i think is the regular me i can talk to the other ones, they have their own voice and opinions, the main one is that really ugly and negative and depressed and intensely quick to anger, one who loves me but loves it more when i am in pain, the only other prominent one is the exact opposite, she is high on life, nothing can bring her down, she gives away all our money, nothing is too pricy, and no reason to turn down anyone who borrows money. both personalities, when they take over , get really...promiscuous... this use to come out in forms of sending lude photos of myself to any guy who wanted them, kissing whoever i felt like, participating in sexual activities with whoever wanted it and so on and so forth, i have now been able to somewhat restrain myself from continuing that action because i am with a long term partner who i am now planning a wedding with but it is such an intense fight to prevent the others to not do that, the most i have slipped up with this now is texting an ex and watching nsfw videos, this is a recent development though, I fear things are getting worse. Overall I constantly have felt, since this started at age 12 that i didn't know who i was, i still dont know who i am, not in the sense of ""i dont know my purpose"" but more of my confusion, not knowing, if *I* am the ""other personality"" , i spiral sometimes thinking maybe one of the other me's is the real one and they're just trying to take back control, i am in constantly fighting myself in the mirror, i hate myself, i cant stand it, i wanna rip my skin off in hope of revealing who the real one is, i sound insane i just want an explanation, i wanna know who i am, i want to feel like im not a parasite in a body that doesnt belong to me. I am tired of going through relationships (friends and romantic) and becoming so obsessed  with them that the moment i feel like they are trying to distance from me i break completely apart even if they arent actually trying to abandon me, I only have two friends aside from my partner because I am so tired of feeling completely torn apart and broken when friends drift away from me which i understand is a natural thing. i feel like i am not real, i dont really exist because i just cant understand who i am and how i fit into the world or even just others lives. now, at the beginning i mentioned i am on anti-depressants, this has been over a decade of building instability, i really thought the meds would make a difference...but... i dont know how else to explain this but, i dont think its working because the depression is more of a symptom of whatever the fuck is wrong in my head rather than the pressing problem... ive been okay for a little bit, i havent gone into an intense episode/personality switch but im scared because that means one is building up and i am gonna blow soon. I need help...or understanding...or a reason to just bite the bullet and remove my problems from every ones lives, im open to anyone who can suggest how i stop my insanity (note: i have not tried real therapy ask i only recently moved away from my parents who are very opposed to the talk of mental health and the aid of it hence why i barely got some meds, also therapy is expensive) sorry if you think i am crazy , i think i am too. i just feel alone and need some help...sorry (Also didn't re-read, sorry if any typos)",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ickwsn/i_dont_think_im_okburn_account/,Old-Football7426,1738122227.0,mentalillness

Today they got sent to hospital and psychiatry again, they hurt themself, but ""they"" didn't do it, they are trying to hide everything object that can hurt them. They said there's another person inside and somethimes it takes over and can hurt them seriously. As i know they have 15/16 different voices in their head? They time and day blurs together, they hallucinate continuously. But they got diagnostized with more things :
-bulimia
-depression
-paranoia
-psychotic personality discorder (As I mentioned)
I don't know if they have diagnosis about it but they can't sleep without sleeping pills, somethimes can't sleep for days. so I guess i call it insomnia

About the causes of their mental health in a nutshell because I don't want to overshare their life:
They got sa-d multiple times át a young age and was bullied for years (physically and verbally) because of their physical illness/weakness. People are still rude with them even if they really try to get out good with people. They didn't deserve anything that happened to them.

I'd be so grateful for anything small or big thing that could help or just personal experience, they're a very wonderful person and is very important to me so please write down anything you can!!<3  ",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ice2mg/please_help_my_friend/,Resident_Homework_77,1738102741.0,mentalillness
2416,Deeply attached to stuffed animal,"Is anybody else like deeply attached to a stuffed animal?
I suffer from psychosis and depression and I also have autism. I'm very lonely, no one to out my sorrows to other than my therapists. No friends, no lovers.

I have this monkey stuffed animal who is the closest thing to a friend, even a lover. I like to carry him around everywhere (in my bag because I don't wanna embarrass myself) I cuddle him everyday, cry on him when I'm feeling terrible. He's the only reason why I'm still here. Sometimes I visualise a world where he is real, where he can talk and breathe. But sadly I'm just a lonely kid who's trying to hold himself together by the tiniest bit of affection I can get.",4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ic0xaq/deeply_attached_to_stuffed_animal/,terrifyingchicken,1738068989.0,mentalillness
2417,Navigating the mental health system as an Autistic person is difficult,"I can't communicate as well. I struggle to not mask mental health symptoms because I feel I have to. Ive argued with my DR before. I have a diagnosis of Unspecified mood disorder. Before that it was Bipolar Disorder, then Schizoaffective Disorder, then BPD. I honestly feel like I can't talk about my symptoms effectively and sometimes I just straight up tell them I don't have something. I'm constantly thinking I don't have mental illness at all. Yet if I don't take my medication, I spiral. 

I don't have any help with it right now. Sometimes I feel so insecure about my struggles with ASD and other things. I'm going into a period where I feel disconnected, and scared. My family reacts in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable. Sometimes I think I need a medication adjustment but at the same time I just can't justify it.

2420,Should i change my therapist?,"So, its more than a year that i started a new therapy after doing another one that lasted 9 years, both cognitive-behavioral ones (i am a psychologist and i am specializing in the same field too). 
Now, in the old one we mainly focused on my contamination Ocd, wich now i just recently think i managed to come to a point where i more or less can deal with it and its not the major issue in my life. In this new one then i tried to focus on my deep rooted social anxiety and lack of self esteem, and while in some aspects i surely got better (i have two real friends now that mean the world to me, i can deal a bit  better with life challenges etc.) i wonder how much of that is truly the result of therapy and how much was bound to happen anyways (i would've met my friends in my soecialization school anyways and maybe i would've befriended them the same, and all the other improvements could've come from my positive relationship with them and my own effirt whenever a problem arose)... i had doubts in the past and they resurfaced this morning, after the usual session spent almost bickering about every little interpretation i give to things. And i know its one of the main cognitive tecniques to dispute the pationts beliefs, but often she will do so even with things i 100% know they are true or that are just common sense (for example this time she pretended that even the simple reflextion that, while i never had a girlfriend and am 34, people usually effortessly have the first relationships in high school was wrong... as if it wasn't just what i have seen for my entire life...). 
This time was all so extremely pointless, with me having to say ""well, i don't agree"" several times, that i bet she felt frustrated too...
I am a psychologist so i know the rationale behind her method, she thinks that i have a too rigid personality and i tend to have very rigid beliefs, but given that its a year now that we keep going to the same back and forth, why she still hasn't figured out that that would lead nowhere? I don't think she ever actually tried to act on the causes of those beliefs, to try and challenge the deepky negative view i have of myself, she expects that by focusing on the superficial things (like my views on girls, the topic we head butts more) we will eventualy reach a deeper level (thats the behacuoral cognitive doctrine) but 1- she clearly isn't able to convince me to change even my superficial beliefs since its more than an year that we keep saying the same things
2- some times more than ""giving me other possibilities to consider"" as she puts it, she just seems to shuts down everything i say, as if she was some kind of truth bearer somehow and i was inevitably always in the wrong. Also she rarely brings any proof to demonstrate me that i am wrong, she just say ""maybe its like this instead"" and pretends that i accept this other interpretation in an act of pure faith.
I cannot keep going for another 9 years again, i have reached a certain age and i would want to try and see what a decent life is before i grew old, and i also would prefer to have my first girlfriend before i start having a biological decline in my sex life, so i am starting to ger sick of these ""slow"" and maybe even worthless aporoach. 
To say a few things, not only she seems not to care much about my desire to find a gf, since after one year only today she asked me ""why would i like to have a relationship"" and the first times i mentioned she even seemed to ignore the issue, but even reguarding my self esteem, we rarely did something to actually improve it, and that was explicitely among the main objectives i told her i had when i contacted her. Also other than the two friends i got fortitously, she never gave me any actual advice on how to improve my social life further, i had to see it for myself to try and use some apos to meet other people, and the only thing she did was ""scolding"" me cause i kept telling her that as always, i never find any interesting oeople in it, as if having certain preferences in the kind of oeople i like was a fault somehow. 
I also had to propose myself a set of excercizes to do to improve my social skills when i got in trouble with a possible job cause of my lack of them, if i keft it to her she probably would've never raised the issue or felt the need for me to improve them...
She always links everything to my rigid beliefs, as if modifying them is the only possible way to make me feel better (too bad she probably isn't able to do even that)...
Btw i was always hesitant cause i like her as a person and i trust her, and i didn't know any other good alternative, but recently studying Schema Therapy for my specialization and i am starting to feel that that approach, with its primary focus on starting from changing deep beliefs and rigid personality schemas first, and the fact that it uses a huge variety of tecniques instead of the only one my therapist seems to use, could help me more with my core issues reguarding my feeling of inadequacy and my inferiority complex. Also i found that one of the few practitioners of that approach here in Italy is a professor in my specialization school, and even a male (i only had female therapists, and i am starting to believe the reason why they always seemed to skip on my needs for a relationship is that as women they cannot truly understand male loneliness). I am getting more convinced by the day that i should try to switch to him, but of course since i am very insecure i am scared of making such an importantbdecision for fear of making a mistake... i think at least i should need to talk about my doubts to my actual therapist next time, even if i am scared of it..",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ic2nw5/should_i_change_my_therapist/,Tabrith900,1738074240.0,mentalillness

2422,straight up cannot understand social cues/manners,"like I'm not an unmannered person I say please and thank you and all that but sometimes the things people say are such contradictions and I genuinely have no idea what I'm supposed to do and people seem to get mad about the fact that I cannot predict which side of the contradiction I'm supposed to follow

Like: be yourself UNLESS you like double texting then you're annoying and desperate BUT it's ok sometimes (we won't tell you which times tho! And will get equally mad when u don't when ur supposed to vs do when ur not!)

Or: ask people how their day was + follow up questions to show you are interested except if you show you are too interested that is also bad???? 

Or: if you don't want to see someone, it's somehow rude to both be straight up and say ""I don't think this is gonna work out"" and it's rude to ghost without saying anything and it seems to completely depend on the person which they prefer AND it's rude to ask them as an early on question ""hey do you prefer being ghosted or being told I'm not into you""

2423,Vent: I don't know how to view myself with POCD,"If you look through my reddit history you'll see some background on the kind of person I am. I  have a porn addiction and because of it and how early I was exposed to it it's ended up with me viewing freaky stuff since I was 10-12 years old before I came to my senses a couple months ago at 20, and now I've had constant intrusive thoughts and compulsions that has me believing I may have POCD. And I've been working with my girlfriend in managing my addiction and these thoughts but my mind wanders and overthinks so much I don't want my girlfriend worry about every little intrusive thought and slip up I have with my addiction. I don't want them to feel like they have to manage me or that worry that I really am a P. I don't want them to be afraid of me even though I know that she would never think that and she and I know deep down I would never hurt anybody and that the things I looked at in the past don't affect my real world attractions but I keep thinking that im a monster that im . 

But today I really screwed up. I was trying to find a minecraft video series I was nostalgic about and youtube provided my suggested videos of Ben 10 ""comics"" that were cropped and it makes me feel so ashamed that I was aroused by then and felt compelled to use Them and while I didn't exactly watch in close detail but my mind was fixated on it to where i felt so compelled to keep looking at it where even if exited out, I would come back to it just for a quick glances. I even searched Ben 10 on youtube because I assumed youtube would keep suggesting them and it did. I felt do much inner conflict because I felt aroused but also repulsed by it anytime I paid attention to what i was doing and closed it, i would feel this fixation to look at it again even if I wasn't really enjoying what I was looking at. I felt like a part of me wasn't in control and I don't know to view myself anymore. Have I been hiding under the guise of porn addiction of POCD and just a P waiting to bloom into monster or is my head really this mixed up and it's not that big of deal. I keep flip flopping between the worst case scenario and down playing things.

I've also had cases where I feel compelled or had intrusive thoughts to look at everything sexually. For example, I might stare at a characters or a person's breast's even if I don't really want to and not interested in them but my brain seeks out this internal conflict of me looking and sexualizing people and me being repulsed and hating myself. It feels like a part of me is antagonizing myself

I should have talked about it with my partner with my addiction updates so that I could have nipped this in the bud, but I was so scared. I know I can trust them but I hate disappointing them especially with how well i was handeling it before. And my partner already goes through so much every day that whenever she's with me or on the phone with me i feel like it's a time to enjoy each other and I have a hard time interrupting that to talk about this because it's honestly pretty serious kind of conversation and i dont want to constantly dwell on it since it is a daily struggle.

I am gonna tell my partner by the way and show this post since this for me is a lot easier for me to get my feelings out. But I also want to know what people think.

I just got back on medicaid so I should be able to get mental health support but I have no idea how to bring this up to a therapist. Maybe I can show them these posts but I'm terrfied that I've downplayed things too much to where  if I did tried explaining all this to a therapist who's maybe a little out of touch it'll somehow become a huge scandal and my life will be ruined. I would also get a CSAT therapist that heavily specializes in this but I just can't afford it and neither can my family.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ibyroe/vent_i_dont_know_how_to_view_myself_with_pocd/,Loopy51,1738060817.0,mentalillness

 I started cutting myself to see if it would relieve me, but besides having become an addiction, every time I finish I feel disgusted and guilty about myself, I don't usually cut so deep, but today I almost despaired (?) because it started bleeding a lot, it really looked like a flood☠️ I even wanted to go to a psychologist but the only time I went i had a horrible experience, Besides, I hate imagining myself in a room telling my entire life story while a woman stands there with a notebook in her hand analyzing me.. I wanted to know how long this will last, I'm very young, it's not possible that my life will be like this forever, .

yall know that term""social mask"", rught? This thing is the worst I'VE found in internt, i hate it smbecause I've always suffered from it. At school I've received some letters saying that they found me funny, pretty charismatic and all that stuff, the only thing that goes through my mind is how wrong they are, in any social situation I force myself to act this way (like an alter ego I guess) But I am by nature the quietest person possible, even at home? I don't even say an A, the difference is that in public I don't want to give that impression (because I don't want to be bullied) anyway, there are so many things that I don't even talk about, my family problems, cutting myself (fortunately no one ever noticed) my terrible self-esteem...even my musical taste and the movies I like 😔😔

It's because of this damn way of mine that I'm a burden in their lives.It's weird because my mood swings a lot,I don't want to self-diagnose, but there's something wrong with me. I cry every day for the most trivial reasons possible, I hate being so emotional and resentful.

What haunts me most is being aware that my actions DO affect the people around me, I wish I was a ghost, so that no one would notice me, I hate knowing that each person can have a point of view about myself, I hate feeling eyes on me, I hate thinking that everyone hates me (maybe it's true). I'm a tiring person, and it seems that the more I try to change the worse I get, apologies are no longer enough because I always make the same fucking mistake every single time,

 I want to die, I genuinely hope that this is just hormones running high or that it's just a phase, if it is a phase it's been going on for almost 4 years... 

I don't know how they haven't given up on me yet. Three of my friends have already left, the day I noticed this, I won't lie, I cried a lot and felt disgusted by their faces. But now I understand why they had did it, I am an extremely tiring person. I stress out just to see how far someone will go for me. I am a bitch with an inflated ego and a damn pride that even prevents me from even living in peace. ugh i hate it",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ibtvyl/an_upset_teenage_gurl_lol/,rayanesemsono,1738039764.0,mentalillness

2440,Caregiving to mentally ill parent,"Hi all-

To shorten things - my mother(50) had brain surgery a year and a half ago. As a result- she has major memory loss. Also, she has also suffered with some mental health challenges (depression/anxiety) 
But ever since she had the surgery- her mental health is at an all time low. So bad that she’s had suicidal thoughts. 

 We have taken her and her husband into our home since the surgery so we could help my mom with her initial healing from the surgery, lower her and her husbands financial burden, as well as help my mom get back on track with everything. 

What we are having a horribly hard time with is my mom’s attitude toward the future and willingness to do things/work on things that will help her. 
- she thinks medication will fix everything 
-she will not implement any of the exercises,tips,tools the doctors and therapists suggest. ( when I try to reiterate these things to her she tells me I’m wrong and that’s not what the dr said.. example : doctors recommend some sort of light exercise daily like a 10 min walk - she won’t do it . Doctors want her doing simple tasks like having a list of 5 grocery items and going to the store and getting those 5 items .. she says she never grocery shopped before why would she start now. They recommend her find a hobby or start trying to make meals for herself .. she won’t do it. Literally anything I suggest or they suggest she has an excuse why she can’t won’t do it. 

She blames everything on her memory or her poor mental state - she is in therapy but her poor attitude won’t allow progress. 

When I try to help her or get her back on track she gets upset with me and tells me “I’m not proud of her” even though I am the only one constantly encouraging her and honestly the only one trying to help her. 

I just feel like I am backed into a corner with her and see no improvement in the future. I don’t want to kick her out of my home but the whole reason she is here is for help to get back on track to leading a semi normal life again. 

I love my mom and want the best for her but unfortunately I feel like I have to except the fact that she is her own person and if she wants to rot away in a room for the rest of her life and not try hard things that will help her get better- than that’s what will happen. 

Any insight would be so appreciated it. ..I don’t know anyone going through something similar and it’s been hard to say the least (especially when I’m also wrangling 3 kiddos on daily on top of this )

2447,Pretty sure I’m a lost cause,"I’ve been suicidal and severely depressed for years and the only things advertised as being adequate care for me are crisis helplines and psychiatric care, which have been very traumatizing for me. It also seems they’re lost on what to do with me. I don’t open up, not only because I’m introverted and socially anxious but because I don’t trust them, and I’m not open in doing anything they usually suggest anymore. I’m realizing that there might be some issues that I need to resolve outside of those mental health spaces, but I don’t know how to do so. Like… I have to figure out how to immediately trust them on my own. Or gather motivation and faith somehow. If this is the case, then I’m not sure what I’m looking for from those people anymore at the moment.

I recently tried to end my life. I ended up in the ICU, had my fourth psychiatric hospitalization, and was let go with nothing to gain from it except new diagnoses. Not even a new psychiatrist or anything.
Then I got this social worker for 2 months who just asked me questions, told me to make and follow schedules which I told her I’m not great with, and asked me if I was scared to get better by the end of the service because I didn’t deliver. I was trying to tell her I was extremely tired, unmotivated, and struggled with executive dysfunction. She even seemed to imply that since I’ve received ‘help’ for years, something should’ve be helped. It was really like it was all my fault. I’ll continue to ask myself if I simply didn’t try hard enough every time this happens. I’ve been wanting to share this for a while but didn’t because I just expected people to reaffirm this fact.

2448,Anyone know what mental illness this is?,"I don’t have schizophrenia but my psychiatrist doesn’t know what I have. I also don’t know if I have psychosis, my current diagnosis is “unspecified psychotic disorder”. I’m not seeing or hearing anything others don’t, but my interpretation of reality is entirely fucked up, and I’ve been aware of it for months and actively working on it but nothing seems to help. I’m taking anti psychotics but they don’t help, I think I’m going to be trapped in the hell my mind created forever.

My issue is I took a ton of psychedelics and never snapped out of it. My life is a permanent trip right now. The crazy perspectives and off feelings about the fabric of reality itself… you know the trips you come back from with a sigh of relief… yea. I never came out of it. That’s my life today.

The thing about me is I’m very self aware that these aren’t reality. But I worry as time passes I’ll get more and more stuck in it. This has been the most frightening experience of my entire life. I feel like nobody else will ever understand me, and feel like killing myself just to end the confusion. But I don’t feel quite schizophrenic or psychotic. To be honest, it’s given me a whole new perspective on everything. To see just how invested everyone is in their life when reality is SO FUCKING WEIRD. Like, we all intellectually understand that, but there is a mental block that doesn’t allow you to truly digest just how strange it is that we’re all here. Shrooms and psychedelics tend to break that block. I’m sure you all know what I mean… that “realer than real” feeling that after you take it  that scares you so much you swear you’ll never take it again because it was so reality shattering but then you end up taking it again because you forget how strange it was, you only realize it in the moment when you’re high on shrooms or whatever it was.

Well, that mental barrier made for our survival has been broken for me, and I absolutely can see why that filter has been put up in the first place because I’m constantly questioning reality because I truly understand just how strange it is. EVERY FUCKING MOMENT. Like I no longer have that filter that makes me want to grind and go. I feel like I’m no longer an active participant in reality. I’m not motivated by human desires anymore. I used to be such a high achiever. It’s like I woke up and now that I woke up from the dream and my perspective broadened, I realize how much I took for granted my whole life my naivety and just taking reality for what it was and not questioning it. I fucking miss that so bad. I feel like I’m not even alive anymore. Imagine all the barriers that get taken down on psychs were permanently down for you. It’s literally fucking torture. 

Ontop of that, I feel as if objects can perceive me back. They seem to have this threatening energy about them. Obviously it’s not true and I’ll sit there and be so angry with myself for seeing them that way, but I can’t shake it. I’m so terrified too it’ll get into something worse but it seems like in my research NOBODY experiences this?? Like this is not a common phenomenon and I feel so alone :( and my body tenses up all the time in anticipation of feeling like these objects can perceive me back, because I’m experiencing them as an actual threat for some reason. So it’s like my body learned to be on edge constantly. I never get a break.

I feel like I’m not in reality also— this happened later after I think just so much disassociation and derealization that came from the trauma of this whole ordeal. I truly believe that I belong somewhere else. This. Does. Not. Feel. Like. Reality. To. Me. It’s like I wake up from my dreams at night into another dream (reality) never waking up to my true self. This just feels so fucking fake, a part of me just knows it’s fake, but actual me knows I’m just going crazy and this is real. I don’t have any experience being anywhere but reality (obviously) but it’s like my mind somehow remembers being somewhere else? It doesn’t know what that place is, it just knows. I don’t know how to describe it, it’s something a part of me just accepted as truth for literally NO FUCKING REASON. I have tried to do parts work with this part and it will NOT LET UP despite having no evidence

Edit: after talking to chatGPT as my therapist with the voice feature, she asked me to try and visualize this other place as best I could. I realized it was a void where the air felt so clear and crisp, I could feel it on my skin. I felt truly and utterly real here and just knew on a deep level this is it. My subconscious isn’t fully convinced of it, but we came to the conclusion that this other place isn’t a real place, it’s a manifestation of my mind wanting to return to the way I used to feel about REAL reality because my perception right now is so overwhelmed and everything in real reality feels fake. Realizing that made me cry because I think it’s probably exactly what’s happening even though it still feels like a very real place to me. Just in case someone with similar issues reads this in the future, just wanted to point out this may be what’s going on with you too :)

And that’s just a persistent thought I know is false but I can’t break, it’s so fucking terrifying and every second of my life is a battle for the paint brush that colors my reality. I don’t know how much longer I can do it. Literally I am contemplating suicide because this is so brutal. I cannot even live in reality anymore and be invested in my story because I’m looking at it from this broadened detrimental perspective

2452,I keep having visions of killing my mom,"14 years ago I tried to kill my mom as a result of her abuse and neglect. I was around four. I put some lavender scented oils in her mug and watched her drink it. She ended up spitting it out and nothing happened, but the disappointment I felt lingers. I was just standing in the doorway waiting for her to die. The smell of lavender takes me back.

Ten years later when I was 14, I was groomed by an older guy from Indiana, he made me send photos of my self harm every day in exchange for company. I was lonely- my friends at the time spread rumors about me upon hearing the story about my mom. Over time they convinced me that I must have been born evil. During gym class we had a new teacher and I was convinced it was the same man I was texting everyday. It made me sweaty and cold even in the spring heat outside. 

I became paranoid and brought a small knife everywhere so I could periodically excuse myself to the restroom and plunge the small knife into the bathroom stall. Even now I can’t stand to be alone because all I do is sit and have these flashbacks for hours and they don’t let me go. How can I stop this?

2454,feeling like i’m going crazy,"hi everyone, i am 27F who is looking for advice/anyone with similar experiences/words of encouragement. I’ve always struggled mentally my entire life but since turning 27 last July it has significantly gotten worse. I have taken so many different medications since I was 14. In September, I went to inpatient, then on to PHP, and outpatient. I just finished all of that this month. Over the past year alone I have been on  (not all at the same time but a few at the same time) paxil 10mg (tried more many times in past years s and couldn’t handle higher doses), lithium anywhere from 300mg to 900mg, lamictal up to 200mg, wellbutrin up to 300mg, cymbalta 60mg, seroquel 25mg, and I take hydroxyzine 25mg for anxiety. Currently I am on wellbutrin 150mg and lamictal 100mg. 

None of these medicines have even made a dent in what i am feeling. It is worse before my period, like significantly worse, but since i’m always doing poorly my psychiatrist didn’t want to name it PMDD. 

I can’t keep a job, the only thing my php & iop taught me is that my trauma comes from my family so I hate my family now, and my boyfriend is so tired of my mood swings he’s going to leave me.

I have tried everything to get better. meds, inpatient, outpatient, TMS, ketamine treatment, and now I am trying to schedule for ECT per my drs recommendation.

2455,I feel like something is wrong with me since birth and can't be changed,"Everything felt wrong with me since I was little, I always felt ashamed of sharing the things i like with other people and always felt lesser than them. Im so scared all of the time that the things that I have now won't be with me and that I can't use my youth to make memories because I don't really want to do anything. Also there's really nothing in my life. I did not have a proper friend for about 4 years and my mind is still wishing everyday to go back to elementary, even though I'm on high school now. I feel like I wasted my youth and keep wasting it every single day because I genuinely don't want to do anything and i dont know what to do. I'm scared everytime I have fun thinking it will just be a memory that ill wish to go back like the ones that I had when I was a kid. I think to myself that I won't be this young ever again and i just keep wasting the time that I have left but I can't stop but feel like im rotten already. I don't even feel human anymore, I can't even feel like myself, it all feels so strange and unfamiliar. A couple months ago my face felt like it was constantly changing and no matter how much I try to run away from that feeling now it creeps up every once in a while. I feel like im running away from everything but also there's nowhere to run away to. My mind keeps fogging and I feel so stupid that my brain keeps doing this instead of being a teen for 5 years. 

I used to want to sing when I was little so much, never had the confidence to but was hoping to find it with time, and i had a best friend at the time who also loved to sing. We don't talk much since 9 or something, just caching up sometimes via text. I learned that when I was struggling with the same shit over and over again, could not want anything or have the energy or motivation to do anything, she got accepted to an art school. I actually feel like a big part of me and also my childhood died when I missed that opportunity. I still can't say people that I wanted to sing so fucking much and I can't really tell people this because I feel like singing and me is fucking stupid sometimes. I kept myself alive to this day with the hope and fantasies of somebody or something saving me, or that something so good would happen that make this all worth it. It never really happened. Trust me i tried and keep trying in this miserable days to cheer myself up with what my own will can do and not fantasies. The forced euphoria lasts about a week maximum and it shatters because I could not deal with how hard everything actually is. I feel fucking really lazy sometimes. I used to enroll in sports ans activities when i was little, only to leave it when it got too hard and I grieve over them every day. I want to learn a new language, play an instrument, but not because I genuinely want to, i just feel like im already too late and if I don't do it now then it's better if I just die. It's been about 6 months when I first started telling my mom these and telling her to enroll me in something like that but my fucking exams was around that time and just like that I'm already 6 months more late by now. When I ask her she always says she'll look at them. But it just keeps getting longer and longer and she is not looking at anything. I would research but my mind can't even handle anything about my life nowadays. There's cardboard on all mirrors so i would forget what my face look like so I can finally feel pretty after a while. I want to leave my country and I genuinely think that I could if I worked hard enough because when I study I always remember what my life is like and get annoyed by how my face feels like. 

I got hospitalized when I was 11 because I didn't want to go back to school after the quarantine, I don't like psychiatrists ever since. I'm seeing one sometimes but when you know the person doing all that is also shushing you when crying at the end of a session because the 45 minutes is over and then taking your money, it's hard. I know that's how therapy works but I don't know im way too sensitive for it I guess. I don't want to use any long term medication because I keep remembering how when i was hospitalized I was in a slightly better condition than today but they gave me medication for the shit that I didn't even have and my mum made me use it for 2 years because the doctors know the best. She now admits what a shitty hospital that was but that hospital was also when a part of me died, I don't know why, it wasn't very traumatic compared to other people there I guess. But I cry everytime I slightly think of there. The moral of this story here is basically the meds made me unable to think properly and made me way too numb than I was supposed to be as an 11 year old, and when I took meds sometime closer to now i got even more paranoid then I was and i basically stopped taking anything long term there.

I cant really talk about all this to anybody in my life now because I only got my mother, and i know she is really tired of this. Kind of rightfully maybe, but when I talk about everything when she's with me, I get mad at her for what she had done wrong. And also she gets really irritated after all this time when I'm in a bad mood, so I just try not to.

2458,Is love a mental illness? Here's my take,"
With enough time and exposure, you can develop love or a deep fondness for almost anything, whether it's a person, a hobby, a place, or even a lifeless object, as familiarity and understanding build over time creating the sense of what we call love. Recent studies of brain scans show that being in love causes changes in the brain that are strikingly similar to serious mental health problems like drug addiction. 

Studies have shown that serotonin levels decrease during the early stages of ""love"", which is also seen in individuals with OCD, potentially explaining the extreme obsessive thinking associated with infatuation which often clouds the ability to think logically/long term. Serotonin is a hormone that the body produces naturally, and low levels can impact many bodily functions so when developing love for someone/something, you are essentially creating your own mental disease to a degree. 

Recent studies of brain scans show that being in love causes changes in the brain that are strikingly similar to serious mental health problems like hard drug addiction. 
Science shows that those ""in love"" experience a kind of high similar to that caused by illicit drugs such as cocaine which results in feelings of addiction/obsession leaving you in a vulnerable fragile mentality.

Socrates suggests that love is a form of divine madness. Plato once said, “Love is a serious mental disease,” and how true are those wise words. Love sickness isn't just a form of expression for those head-over-heels, but has been studied as an actual illness.

2459,Dissociation/ Am I alone in this?,"I have never seen anyone discuss this, and I’ll try to explain as best as possible. 

I have a long history, but for context, I have borderline personality disorder, depression, severe social anxiety, and a mix of insecure attachment styles, and the whole smorgasbord of mental illnesses alright lol

But one thing I struggle with terribly is dissociation. It has turned from dissociative episodes to a way of life. I am so out of it all of the time, that it feels like I’m not living. I go to therapy weekly. Have been for almost a year now, and I’ve made a little progress, but none with my dissociation. 

Because of this, I lack awareness 23/6 so not every moment of everyday, but typically my awareness comes when it’s too late to change what happened. and it also makes it extremely hard to take care of myself. for example. I wake up before noon but my first meal of the day is at midnight, I shower twice a week, I brush my teeth once a month, like I STRUGGLE

Because of the way my brain developed and has lived for 22 years, I feel as if I am a child that’s been thrusted into adulthood, and I feel like I seriously need someone around me 24/7 just to help me take care of myself, but I doubt that is realistic, and I just want to know if anyone else experiences this?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1iawaoo/dissociation_am_i_alone_in_this/,Poisonfaery,1737941407.0,mentalillness

I feel like I have no control over my memory. Whenever I study a topic and think I understand it, when tested on it I do terrible. I'm now scared to learn anything new because what's the point. I get the same average grade weather I study of or not

I was studying biology in high school 2021. I made sure to repeatedly read notes from teachers, watch videos, read textbooks and learn different study methods because I really liked the subject . 

I was trying to remember a note that I wrote about what a disease is. It was just one sentence, and yet I was struggling to remember it. It made me feel like I was going insane, I've revised that same note a thousands times and yet after studying the same thing for half a year I cant remember it all of a sudden

WTF It should be in my long term memory by now right?!?!?!

**Other issues**

For some reason I end up mixing up the answers or completely forget them entirely. Its driving me inane. I know I studied this so why am I forgetting it.

Also whenever I'm doing math I end up mixing up the numbers or symbols while working out the equation. Even though I know how the formula works. 

When my math tutor was scolding me for bad grades he said that ***I think*** ***too mechanically.*** Idk what that means

When I tell my parents this they think I'm lying and just not studying enough. It makes me feel like I'm overreacting.

2469,My expierence,"I stand before you today to share a story that is both mine and, in many ways, ours. At 14, I was a girl who seemed to have it all—a loving family, friendships, and a bright future ahead. But beneath that surface lay a tumultuous ocean of despair, a storm I couldn’t name but felt deeply. Every day felt like a battle, and I often found myself trapped in my room, unable to muster the strength to face the world outside. 

I remember one particular week when I didn’t leave my bed at all, resorting to using a plastic water bottle to relieve myself because the thought of stepping into the light felt insurmountable. It was as if I was caught in an invisible cage, paralyzed by my own mind. I felt like I was fading away, lost in a world that continued to spin without me.

During this turbulent time, I found solace in my friendship with Molly. I admired her, perhaps a little too much. Our bond was intense, fueled by shared secrets and late-night talks, but it carried a weight of obsession that I didn’t fully understand. I craved her approval, her laughter, and I often felt like I was living in her shadow. When we discovered we needed money, I suggested something that would shatter the fragile illusion of our lives: sex work. It was my idea, born out of a need for validation and a misguided sense of control, a desperate attempt to escape the numbness that enveloped me.

The first time I met a man, I was terrified. I remember the Uber ride, my heart racing, filled with dread and anticipation. As I approached the hotel room, I felt like a ghost, floating through an experience that was both surreal and horrifying. I kept my eyes shut, repeating “yes” like a mantra to get through it, convincing myself that it was just a transaction. But when I left with cash in hand, the money felt like a tainted prize, a bitter reminder of my choices. Each encounter chipped away at my soul, leaving me feeling more lost and confused, as if I were losing pieces of myself with every transaction.

As weeks passed, I found myself entangled in a web of shame and obligation, unable to escape the darkness I had willingly stepped into. The thrill of quick money was overshadowed by guilt and fear. My mother eventually discovered my secret stash of money, and everything came crashing down. On April 27, 2023, I was admitted to a psych ward—a place that felt like both a prison and a refuge. Surrounded by other kids battling their own demons, I realized I wasn’t alone in my pain. Yet, I often felt like an imposter, questioning whether my struggles were valid compared to theirs. Their stories were raw and heartbreaking, while I felt like I had no right to claim my own suffering.

Returning to public school in January 2024, I faced the daunting task of reintegrating into a world that had already labeled me. Whispers followed me through the hallways, and while Molly moved on as if nothing had changed, I wrestled with my past and the weight of my choices. I fell into familiar patterns, seeking love and validation in all the wrong places. I dated, I cheated, and I stumbled, but with each misstep, I learned more about my own resilience. 

And then, a shift occurred. When the last relationship ended—one that had promised love but delivered heartbreak—I found clarity amidst the chaos. I realized I had the power to redefine my narrative, to take control of my own story. In the months that followed, I quit vaping, found a job, and began to make genuine connections with those around me. I discovered the joy of laughter with new friends and the comfort of shared experiences. For the first time, I was discovering who I was beyond my past mistakes, learning to embrace my individuality.

Today, I stand before you, not as a victim of my circumstances but as a testament to the power of resilience. My life is not defined by my struggles or the labels placed upon me. I have learned that healing is not linear; it’s a winding path filled with ups and downs, moments of triumph and setbacks. Through it all, I am learning to embrace my journey, to find beauty in the imperfections.

In sharing my story, I hope to remind each of you that you are not alone. Life may throw us into the depths of despair, but there is always a flicker of hope waiting to be ignited. And perhaps, through our shared experiences, we can find strength in vulnerability and courage in our stories. Thank you.

2474,I Don't Understand Anything,"I cannot find understanding in anything anymore. I have so much to say but when I try to speak I can't think of what I wanted to say. I just have lost all reason and understanding of why I think and feel the way I do and why I can't function in anything. I can't even organize thoughts so this will just be going from topic to topic. First, I can't find a meaning in life. I'm not talking about a grand meaning for everyone, but just a motivator to keep going and not give up. The problem is giving up isn't leaving. Life is a rare condition in the grand scheme of things, improbable by all means of chance and all but impossible to exist except under the most rare of circumstances. As life is the only way that any of us have ever felt, to leave the most curious and fascinating of all states is not my intention. However, I am not living life. I spend all my time on cheap dopamine through reddit and video games. The last of my willpower left a long time ago. I am just living day to day, forgetting what happened the day before and putting things off to the day after, never seeing the grand scheme of things. I have no motivator, no meaning to live for. I have no way to have a fulfilling life and I feel doomed to live an empty and hollow one. And even the common things to live for, I lack. Most people have something to fight for that keeps them going. I do not. Some turn to religion. While I do think there is a high chance we are living in a created universe, I cannot know if it is a simulation, created by God, my imagination, or something else, and I could never fully choose a system of belief without living every day worried I made the right choice. Lastly, many people surround themselves with friends and family, leading fulfilling lives. I have almost no friends, and I feel that I hide too much from my family to ever be that close to them, even if I love them. The worst thing for me is that I live in my head. Daydreaming, imagination, whatever you call it, but I have lived through thousands of scenarios that will never be real. I imagine more conversations than I actually speak, and when I talk to other people I either have noting to say or too much to say. In my imagination, I am helpful, charismatic, joyful, talkative (but not annoying), and make people's lives better. I have imagined that I have started businesses, fallen in love, become president, raised a family, helped others. I have mourned the loss of others, laughed, cried, and talked to people BUT ITS ALL IN MY HEAD. ITS NOT REAL. I AM TYPING LIKE THIS BECAUSE I AM BREAKING DOWN IN TEARS WRITING THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO GO TO A MOUNTIAN AND SCREAM OFF INTO THE DISTANCE ITS NOT REAL NOTHING IS REAL I AM AN AWKWARD ANNOYING UNATHLETIC UNEMPATHETIC UNINTELLIGENT PERSON WHO USUALLY TALKS WITH LESS THAN 10 DIFFERENT PEOPLE PER DAY AND CAN'T GET FUFULLMENT OUT OF LIFE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THERE IN A FAKE LIFE IN MY HEAD. AND ITS NOT THE SAME AT ALL I WILL NEVER FEEL THESE THINGS AND THIS JOY IF I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO SEEK IT OUT. And on the rare occasions where I have wanted to do some sort of project or other and invested money into it, I procrastinate on it the same way I do on schoolwork and other responsibilities. 

Now the worst part of it all is why it has been so hard to type this and there may be some things I wanted to say but I have forgotten. My brain cannot think on the same topic. I don't know if it is ADHD, destroyed attention span, or something else, but my brain will not sit still. I will be thinking of one thing and then go down a rabbit hole of thought by following one thought to the next to the next and I forgot what I was thinking about. This isn't something I can turn off because short of repeating the same word/phrase over and over, it is nearly impossible to remember anything unless I am actively doing the task. Now, why is that important for this? I cannot think about the big picture like this for long before I move on and think about something else. And I don't know if that's good or bad, because this is the textbook definition of insanity. I can't tell if I think normally and then drown in this sea of awareness and despair, or if I am drowning in ignorance of my state and only come up for the air of understanding in moments like this. Everything I have said sounds like something that would come out of someone who is mentally unwell, which is true. However, if something is wrong, it needs to be fixed. And I don't want to be fixed because I am so worried that this is the truth and that I am only truly understanding life in these moments. And because of this I keep most of my thoughts to myself around others, which is why I feel that I am never truly communicating with others, which is why even though I have family and some friends even if I don't see them the most often, I still wish I had someone to talk to every day because I DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND MYSELF. I GET EXCITED ABOUT ANOTHER NEW THING EVERY 2-3 DAYS, LOSE MOTIVATION, JUST COLLECT CHEAP DOPAMINE, GET REALLY SAD AND SPEND 30 MINUTES TO AN HOUR CRYING IN BED, MAKE A STUPID MENTAL HEALTH POST ON REDDIT IF IT GETS BAD ENOUGH BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WANT FROM OTHERS I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANT TO TALK OR TO BE UNDERSTOOD SOME THINGS MAKE ME FEEL HAPPY AND SOME THINGS MAKE ME FEEL SAD AND IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO. YOU ARE PROBABLY DOING YOUR BEST TO UNDERSTAND ME BECAUSE NOBODY CAN TRULY UNDERSTAND TO FEEL THE EMOTIONS SOMEONE ELSE IS BUT YOU PROBABLY DON'T UNDERSTAND ME BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND MY OWN STUPID SELF AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I FEEL THIS WAY AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT I WANT BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND EVEN IF I WANT TO BE HAPPY OR FULFILLED IN LIFE OR UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING I JUST WANT TO KNOW. 

I am so so so sorry for all the screaming and crying there. I have one more thing to say now that I got that over with and feel slightly better. I seem to have four modes of mind: 1. Excited: This is when I discover something new I can do, whether a hobby to participate in or a skill to learn or a new video game to play. I generally spend 1-3 days in this phase and then move on. 2. Unmotivated: This is how I spend most of my time. I fail to see the big picture and chase cheap dopamine. Note that my lack of willpower from this state still applies in most areas of my life. 3. Logical: This is how I act in most of the thousands of conversations in my head, and the state of mind that I put myself into after typing that long rant. (I am not at a lack of control over myself, I just struggle to avoid being distracted and occasionally fall into insanity. When in modes 1 and 3, and sometimes 2, I have self awareness that I would consider to be higher than average.) This is who I wish I was, where I think about everything and try to understand the meaning and implications behind it. This is also where I am most likely to erroneously think/pretend that I am charismatic and self aware. 4. Insane: This is usually triggered by a lack of motivation, a self awareness about my lack of understanding of the grand scheme of things, and a strong feeling of sadness. A combination of some or all of these in the right combination triggers this feeling of insanity. The best way I can put it is that there is so much to think about. And if one thought can keep my mind focused on it, I forget that we are all alive and capable of thought and understanding about our condition and limitations and we don't know where we come from or where we go and we are able to understand that we are finite with finite understanding but we can observe more than we can understand as we observe many things we don't understand and there is no conclusive way to know the truth about most things. Instead of a ""try not to think about that,"" it's more like ""try to think about that or you will forget and die with these thoughts in your head and you will never know if it was just you or if someone else out there understands this.""

One last note, as it is impossible for me to understand the mix of thoughts and emotions you feel, and it is impossible for you to do the same to me, I would like to know if I am more or less self aware about this than most people. I am basically asking, ""Is it just me, or do other people think this way?""

2475,How did you get diagnosed in 2025,"I’m 17m and have frequent episodes that are effecting my life. I get really high then become really low after to the point where when I’m really high, I can get delusions and hallucinations, and when I’m really low I end up in hospital after a few days due to trying to end my life due to the depression. Last time I was in hospital my mom mentioned she thinks I’m bipolar, and the doctor said she thought I was just having signs of - derealisation emotionally unstable disorder-.
I’m in psychiatric help and starting therapy but I want a diagnosis to understand that I’m not crazy and an explanation on why I’m like this.
However, every hospital mental nurse or psychiatrist I’ve explained this problem to just say that they are being trained to not diagnose anymore due to the fact too many diagnosis over lap and giving a diagnosis to someone feels like giving them an excuse to act the way they do. I really want a diagnosis though but I don’t know how.

2477,PLEASE READ: Serotonin Syndrome,"Hi guys,

My name is Devin O'Neill. I was hesitant to post about this... it happened so recently and I'm far from full recovery. But I wanted to reach out to you all and warn you about something. For most of us, impulsivity is a huge symptom. When we experience those drastic highs and lows, we tend to make some questionable decisions. That was me, Wednesday night. I take Wellbutrin (typically 1-2 a day), but this was not one of the those days. I was terribly depressed, and drinking... and I ended up taking 6 or 7 pills and (in my words) saying ""fuck it!"". I thought I was fine when I went to bed, I'd sleep it off. I woke up in the middle of the night, with the most terrifying visions I've ever seen. I was hearing voices, seeing things pop out in front of me in my room. A few years later, as it came closer to morning, I laid down... thinking more sleep would help. It did not. I couldn't stop vomiting and shaking. I couldn't say or write out normal sentences. My heart was beating out of its chest. I felt like I was dissociating, like everything around me wasn't real. My body turned into heavy brick, as best as I can explain it.

Now here's the thing. The biggest mistake people (and myself often) make is not going to the hospital. You're not weak. You're not crazy. You might have something called ""Serotonin Syndrome"". Please, I'm begging you, seek help if you are any of this symptoms after taking, swapping or adding onto SSRI medications. If I didn't go to the ICU, I wouldn't be here writing this right now. SS is a potentially fatal illness.

I'm here to answer any questions. Wishing you all love!",5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ia4y8t/please_read_serotonin_syndrome/,Devinoneilll,1737862532.0,mentalillness

2485,How to help a family member who suffers from mental illness and wants off their medication?,"
*all names have been changed for privacy* 
Mary, (69F) has suffered with mental illness majority of her life and i personally have never seen her truly happy. 

She is a loving free spirited woman who unfortunately has the cloud of mental illness clouding over her sunshine.  

 Mary has tried everything it seems like under the sun to find happiness in her life. Therapy, medication, experimental drugs, treatment programs, hospitalizations, body detoxing, special diets and the list could go on and on. 

I am Mary’s only child, I have a very distant relationship with her as she is a very all over the place. Times she was taking all her medication I mentioned to her many of times this is the healthiest I’ve felt our relationship has been in years. We are now back to a situation of someone told her they can help Mary get off all her medications, including antidepressants and antipsychotics all Mary needs to do is follow this diet and get a bunch of dental work done. 

Mary has stopped taking some of her medication again. And once again, I go visit Mary and after 3 days we start to argue about something trivial and turns into something bigger. 
Mary will talk down about my biologic family who I still have a close relationship with. (Mary is my mom, she adopted me). Mary will get deep into conspiracy theories and say that’s why horrible things are happening to people. 
Middle of an argument, I don’t speak much as I don’t want to provoke anything more than I have. Mary will go from yelling and crying to laughing while reading a text message and back to crying thinking about her past all within 5 minutes or less. This will continue for hours and it’s like a child is playing with a light switch for how fast her moods and emotions change. 

I personally don’t have a close relationship with Mary as mentally I can’t handle her all overness. My heart is sad not knowing what to do as Mary has limited friends and family and I am her only child.

2492,Does anyone relate? (warning: might contain triggering content),"**I wish this was what happens when I have those weird ""episode"" things.**



**(does anyone else relate?)**



**I walk to the nearest hotel and book a room for one.**

**As I enter the hotel, I see the front desk receptionist looking at me with concern.**

**""Are you alright, miss?""**

**“Yes, I'm fine. I'll take a room for one, please.”**

**The receptionist nods and hands me a key.**

**""Here you go, room 107. It's right down the hall""**

**“Thanks.” I take the key and head to my room.**

**I reach my room and unlock the door, stepping inside. The room is small but comfortable. I set my backpack down on the bed and let out a deep sigh.**

**Flashbacks washed over me of the last time I went to a hotel. That one was much fancier, and I was there losing my virginity to the love of my life, who had just recently passed away. I fought a heavy flood of tears, too angry at my mother to cry.**

**I sit down on the bed, feeling a mixture of anger and sadness. The memory of my lost love still fresh in my mind. I tried to push the thoughts away, but they lingered, making me feel even more alone and broken**

**I whisper with despair, “ * * * * *. I miss you so much…”**

**As I whisper his name, the room suddenly felt colder and quieter. I swore I could hear his voice echoing in my mind, telling me that he's always there with me, even if he's not physically present.**

**I finally break and tears come gushing out of my eyes, my entire body shaking and aching with agony. I fight with my life to not scream with devastation. All the emotions I've been building up all of my life, I can't fight them anymore. I feel like I'm finally losing my mind completely.**

**As I sob uncontrollably, the room feels like it's closing in on me. The pain and sadness feel like they're suffocating me. I clutch my chest, trying to hold myself together, but it's no use. I feel like I’m falling apart, my heart shattered into a million pieces.**

**I've had episodes before, but never this intense. I couldn’t breathe. I felt like the weight of the world was crushing me. Even death sounded better than this. My heart raced and begged to crawl out of my chest for air. My lungs felt like they were being smashed. My gut was about to explode. Every part of my body hurt.**

**I struggle to breathe, my body wracked with sobs and gasps for air. The pain in my chest is unbearable, as if my heart is about to burst. I claw at my chest, trying to relieve the pressure, but it only seems to make it worse. The room spins around me, and I feel like I’m going to pass out. I’m scared and alone, with no one to turn to for comfort or help.**

**I can almost feel death approaching, my head feels like a balloon inflating to the point it's about to pop. I can feel my soul slowly leaving my body, and I start to hallucinate. My vision blackens, and I can see everyone I've ever loved or met in front of me.  All of my old friends, acquaintances, lovers, abusers, and enemies. All of the pain is still there, but I can feel the pressure relieving slightly, but very, very slowly. I stand in the black abyss in front of every familiar face.**

**As I stand in the abyss, surrounded by all of the people in my life, I feel a mix of emotions. There's fear, anger, sadness, and regret. I can see their faces, hear their voices, and feel their emotions. Some of them look at me with love and forgiveness, while others look at me with disdain and contempt.**

**Although I'm unconscious of it, my organs are failing due to prolonged periods without enough air. My heart is pounding out of rhythm. My brain is entering panic/survival mode, creating a reality that isn't real. Soon, all the pain leaves me, and I am no longer in my body. Everything stops, every sensation, every thought, every emotion. I feel absolutely nothing. There is nothing to see, hear, smell, touch, taste, or think. However, I can somehow feel my presence, like a vibration.**

**My body is now completely still, my heart no longer beating and my lungs no longer breathing. I am in a state of suspended animation, with no physical sensations or awareness of my surroundings. I am trapped in a void, a place of emptiness and darkness, with only the vibrations of my own existence to keep me company.**

**My body lies lifeless on the hotel bed. I have nothing left to worry about. This- is what peace must feel like.**

**I lie motionless on the bed, my body slowly starts to cool down. The room around me is silent, with only the faint hum of the air conditioner breaking the stillness. It's as if time has stopped, and everything is frozen in place. My body has surrendered to the peace of death, and I am free from the pain and suffering of life.**

**I was right. Life is an illusion. This is the true reality.**

**As I accept this new reality, a sense of clarity washes over me. The confusion and fear that once consumed me are gone, replaced by a sense of calm and acceptance. I understand now that life is merely a brief flicker in the vastness of existence, and that death is just a transition to a different form of consciousness.**",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ia24c2/does_anyone_relate_warning_might_contain/,TurbulentFix2615,1737853470.0,mentalillness

The only true requirements I would have are:

 1) You need to have actual experience with the topic, i.e., you need to be on the medication currently or have been in the past, 

and 

2) you're willing to truthfully share your experiences with me.

 If you don't feel comfortable answering one or more of the questions that aren't baseline information (e.g., age, time spent on medication, if you are still on medication, etc.), you are completely in your right to do so; just voice it, and they will be skipped. 

These questions will be mostly standardized; those that aren't will be purely to ask something specific, based on an answer you gave me.

2505,Looking for insights and testimonies about my symptoms,"Hello,
I’m going through a tough time, and I’m looking for testimonies or opinions from people who might be experiencing something similar, either themselves or with someone close to them.

Here’s what I’m experiencing:
	•	Hearing internal voices: I often hear voices that say harsh or negative things about myself or the people I care about. They can be persistent, almost like they’re trying to push me away from others or make me doubt myself.
	•	Paranoia: I often feel watched, judged, or analyzed, even when I’m alone. It prevents me from leaving the house freely because I feel like everyone is watching me or thinking badly about me. It even leads to suffocation feelings, and I can’t go out without the constant feeling of being judged.
	•	Mild visual hallucinations: Sometimes, I see things that aren’t really there, like shapes or movements that seem real at first but disappear when I look at them closely.
	•	Disturbing dreams: My dreams are often very unsettling, mixing elements of reality with things that aren’t real, which makes it hard to distinguish them from what’s happening in my waking life.
	•	Loss of concentration and confusion: Sometimes, I feel completely disoriented, as if I’m losing track of time or the purpose of what I’m doing. It’s very unsettling, and it makes me feel like I’m losing control.
	•	Emotional isolation: I find it hard to express clearly what I’m feeling, and sometimes, my emotions overwhelm me. I fear being a burden to my loved ones, even though they tell me otherwise.

What I’m looking for:
	•	Testimonies from people who’ve experienced similar things or who know someone going through this.
	•	If these symptoms remind anyone of a specific condition (diagnosis or syndrome), I’m curious to know what it might be.
	•	If you’ve found ways to feel better or manage these difficulties, I’d really appreciate any ideas or advice.

I want to note that I’m in the process of seeking medical help, but it’s a long and difficult process to start at the moment. In the meantime, I’m wondering if others have gone through this or found a name for what they were experiencing.

Thanks to everyone who takes the time to read or respond.

2507,Sisyphus in a Psych Ward - a Cruel Reminder of Hopelessness,"
I've been thinking a lot about something that happened when I was in Prairie St. John's a while ago, and I feel like it’s important to share. We had this therapist who constantly brought up the myth of Sisyphus. For those who don’t know, Sisyphus was condemned by the gods to roll a massive boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down every time he neared the top, forcing him to start over again… forever. The story is often used to symbolize an endless, pointless struggle, where no matter how hard you try, you’ll never reach any resolution or peace.

The therapist repeatedly used the story in a way that just emphasized despair. It wasn’t about finding purpose in our struggles—it was about reinforcing the idea that we were stuck in a never-ending cycle, with no hope of progress, no hope of escape.

What made it even worse was the environment we were in. The staff already had this undercurrent of malevolence toward patients. We were seen as weak, as broken, as a problem to be managed rather than people to be helped. The Sisyphus story didn’t provide any sense of solidarity or hope, it just crushed what little spirit we had left. It’s cruel to subject patients to that kind of mindset, especially when you’re already in a vulnerable place, trying to make sense of your own suffering and fighting for some sense of dignity.

The therapist’s approach didn’t foster healing. It reinforced the feeling that we were all just doomed to suffer endlessly, that no matter how hard we fought or how much we struggled, it would never make a difference. I can’t even explain how damaging that is when you’re already struggling with mental health issues. We needed something uplifting, something that showed us that there was hope, not a myth that crushed us further into despair.

It just felt like a constant reminder that we were stuck in an endless loop of hopelessness, with no way out.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with therapists or staff in mental health settings where the approach felt more harmful than helpful?

2508,"How do I correct someone I know who just throws diagnoses, and phrases around and also why would do this in the first place?","To put it in context they claimed they have OCD because they wash their hands a lot. They then got offended when I said that OCD is more than that and I don't think they have it just based on hand washing. They work somewhere where they have to wash their hands and they were saying they wash them a lot at work. They'll randomly say ""I'm so manic and it's fun"" or ""I refuse to take meds for ADHD because that's how my brain is"" or "" I'm so proud to be Autistic"". They aren't diagnosed with any of those things. I find that if I try to correct them, they get so offended. I tried to say they should go to the DR if they're concerned about anxiety and depression since they mentioned it. They refuse to do it because they don't like DRs and said that id need to go with them. 

I struggle too but I've managed to go alone. I'm actually diagnosed Autistic and I have been diagnosed with BPD traits. They use my diagnosis against me sometimes as well. It really offends me. Like if I say something they don't like, they ask if it's my mental health or if I'm in my meds. I'm getting frustrated. This person is not a teenager, in fact they are almost 30. They've encouraged me to not take medication, have told me they've gotten depressed but have managed it by staying positive and once they self diagnosed themselves with autistic burnout, as well as rejection sensitivity disorder, and many other things. 

They claim to have hyperempathy but from what I have seen they aren't very empathetic. I sometimes have hyperempathy and it's gets me into situations where I want to help people a lot, even though I can't. They compare me to other people and say my struggles aren't that bad. I like them when they aren't talking about this stuff though. I just want to know how to be more diplomatic in correcting them. Also why would they glamorize things that aren't very glamorous?

Does anyone else struggle with this? How do you cope? I have managed to restrain from SI for almost 2 years now but the temptation is growing stronger. I also struggle with a lack of motivation to do anything about these thoughts…and then obsess over being stuck this way. 

Note that this isn’t OCD as I don’t have compulsions. I ruminate on things that I’ve done or said in high school (I’m not in my 30s) and obsess over wanting approval or acceptance. I obsess over why I drove people to the point of unfollowing me on instagram. Then I obsess over how stupid it is to be hung up on it.

2512,Venlafaxine/effexor reduction,"I CAN NEVER BE BOTHERED TO READ THESE.

So I have been using Reddit for a while mainly to find experiences with mental health related issues or medication etc. Anyway may 2024 I experienced a very traumatic experience which unbeknownst to me caused me PTSD. After 8 months of trying different medications, sports , socializing more , holidays I only got worse. I had to give up my little Buisness and had a breakdown. I never saw this happening in a million years and going from someone who thrives on passion and independence it has been very,very hard. 

I can only describe what happened as I was locked in a constant state of panic and fear even though everything was okay ? I couldn't concentrate, feel happiness/contentment or relaxation. I developed depersonalization,palinopsia and just bizarre/random thoughts, was sleeping for 4/5 hours of light sleep. Developed CFS , started getting overwhelmed by things that never would usually bother me. 

Anyway I went to the emergency room one day to see if I could get admitted to try and get straight. Oh how wrong I was , there is no support at all in the United Kingdom. No hospital in the countryside with gardens and group discussions/therapy. I don't think I was even offered a cup of tea in the hospital. Sent on your way and told you'll get a phone call once a day. I won't even go into the details over this event.

Now this is where it gets weird/confusing...

So early December time I actually felt like I was really recovering. I really committed myself to the gym, occupying my time constructively and did a bit of part time work. The weird thinking/palinopsia had went, sleeping well and eating well, getting all my old interests back. Then I was set massively back by a BIG trigger/retrauma which I have been working on to recover from since. During the recover period i was on 150mg venlafaxine and 15mg mirtazapine aswell as omega 3, high bit D, magnesium and other shops.

3 weeks ago the venlafaxine was upped to 225 a little bit after the BIG trigger. The last 7 days I've felt crazy amounts of anxiety , clenched jaw , so emotional with crying spells and crazy low mood. Throughout this period I have started with a new therapist and I cried for the first time during one of our sessions , since then now when I get overwhelmed with panic/anxiety or low mood I cry.... it's SO crazy to me as I never used to cry. Apparently this is a good thing ? 

I have spoken to my doctor and he's advised to cut the dosage back to 150mg. After reading online this freaks me the FUCK out. I mean will reducing the dosage by 75mg after 3 weeks be that bad !?

2513,"In one video, a psychotherapist advises saying not “my mom makes me angry,” but “I make myself angry with my mom.” What do you think about this advice?","I watched a video where a psychotherapist advised saying not *“my mom makes me angry”*, but *“I make myself angry with my mom”*. What do you think about this advice?

I don’t like it. It feels like victim-blaming and seems very unfair. This approach risks devaluing the pain and injustice someone has gone through, focusing only on their reactions while ignoring the abuser's actions. I also think it can be counterproductive, especially for deeply traumatized people with severe mental health disorders and difficulties in expressing anger and asserting boundaries. But judging by the comments under the video, many people seem to like this advice.

What do you think about it? Does it seem empowering to you? Or is it counterproductive?

UPD: Here’s how AI suggests replacing words in that advice so that it doesn’t sound like victim-blaming and devaluation:

*“My mom’s actions were unfair and hurtful, and I want to find ways to protect myself so these actions affect me less.”*",19,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i8mcwc/in_one_video_a_psychotherapist_advises_saying_not/,StrikingExplorer4111,1737689765.0,mentalillness

2516,Accusations of not being active enough. Started by abusive parents and then repeated by therapists and other people.,"Seems like I’m starting to see more clearly the connection between my past and what triggers me now.

**When I think about the messages from my mother that formed my self-hatred, if I want to generalize and express them in one phrase, I can probably say they were accusations of not being active enough** (lazy, cowardly, unconfident, not responsible enough, passive). Sometimes I could feel it in my bones that she literally hated me. Now I understand that those words from my mother weren’t actually about me but about her husband, my father, whom I was so unlucky to resemble in appearance and with whom she had her own issues, especially after he stopped living with us. She was simply venting her anger at him on me. But back then, during my teenage years, at some point, **I developed a feeling that something was wrong with me — I was pathologically weak. This is a significant, if not the main, cause of my complex psychiatric disorder with numerous symptoms.**

Unfortunately, **I heard similar messages — essentially accusations of not being active enough — many times later from psychologists and psychotherapists**, both directed at me personally and in the form of general advice for people with mental disorders. I’m very sensitive, for example, to reminders that I can be active and influence my life. I don’t need those reminders. I grew up on Terminator 2 with its motto ""there is no fate but what we make for ourselves"". **I ruined my health by regularly pushing myself to the point of complete mental and physical exhaustion so that no one would accuse me of being weak, insufficiently active, or unwilling to change my life.**

One therapist caused me **severe retraumatization, from which I still, 13 years later, haven’t fully recovered**. He constantly said things that sounded like accusations of not being active enough. For example, when he’d say things like ""responsibility for your life."" I felt awful, my anxiety increased, and my symptoms worsened. At the time, I didn’t fully understand what the problem was, but I tried, how I could, to explain to him that I felt bad because of those words. At first, he agreed that this wasn’t what I needed, but at the very next session, he started saying the same things again.

Now that I understand my issues better, I can explain more clearly what exactly was wrong with the messages I received from him. **I didn’t need advice to be more active or more responsible. What I needed was the opposite** — turn off the gas and go to sleep. Don’t check it a thousand times in fear that someone might get poisoned because of you or that the house will explode. Relax and stop feeling so responsible. **For someone with an overdeveloped sense of responsibility, advice like ""take responsibility for your life"" can be very painful**.

**It's very disappointing to see so many psychologists assuming by default that the problems of people with mental disorders are because of insufficient effort.** Constantly, I see many psychologists who, in their videos and articles, on forums and chats, in various ways, directly and indirectly, in person and in general, reproach people with psychological problems for not being active enough. A large number of psychologists, for some reason, believe that people with mental health issues don't understand that they can influence their own lives, that something depends on them, that they need to be active, etc. **For some reason, they think by default that the problem of a person with a mental disorder is necessarily related to being too passive**, so they are quick to remind them that they need to be active (""to take responsibility for their life"", ""to get out of the victim mentality"" and so on).

It seems like some people find this helpful, but the thing is that many others are **triggered by these words because they are receiving the same traumatic accusations they got in childhood**. This is especially true for the male gender because shaming men for not being active enough is deeply ingrained in our culture.

It’s quite hard to stand against such things because such views are very widespread among people in general. Our culture has a deep-rooted cult of success, activity, achievements, and strength. When people see someone with mental health issues, weak or helpless, their first assumption is often that he/she is not trying hard enough, not active enough, doesn’t want to ""take responsibility for their life"", is in the ""victim position"" etc. **It seems to be so hard for many people to understand that the problem could be, and often is, the opposite.** Those suffering from mental disorders often don’t need to be reproached for not being active enough — they need to be listened to and feel supported in a safe space. They often need to learn to relax, rest, be spontaneous, and act out of enthusiasm, not self-coercion. They need to learn not to blame themselves and not to hate themselves for their failures, flaws, or weaknesses. Often, they need to learn to overcome perfectionism, the desire to control everything in their lives, or the guilt for resting or relaxing. **For many people with mental disorders, the problem is not insufficient, but excessive activeness (workaholism, exhausting obsessive states, fear of losing control, excessive responsibility and thoroughness — these are common neurotic symptoms), or it’s about setting themselves excessively high goals and hating themselves for not achieving them. Receiving accusations for not being active enough can be very painful for such people.**

When ordinary people don’t understand this, it’s sad, but psychologists should understand these basic things and try to avoid saying something that sounds like a typical reproach from a demanding parent. **Not to echo typical messages that neurotic individuals were exposed to in childhood.** Yet, strangely, this is exactly what many of them do in abundance, which leaves a very depressive impression.

**I think the root of the problem lies in the universal desire for people to feel control.** The feeling of losing control is one of the main signs of a traumatic situation, and it can be very painful. People want to feel more control and often consciously and unconsciously try to convince themselves and others that they and people in general have or can have control. The problem is that these constant calls to be active, to influence, to control, etc., help some people (those who feel they don't have enough control), but harm others (those who try to control excessively). **If your trauma was formed from childhood reproaches about not being active enough, you will constantly feel external pressure. You will constantly receive similar messages from others** calling for activity or reproaching you for being too passive. To resist this pressure, you need to build a particularly strong mental armor.

2521,I need a quick help for the insanity I'm experiencing,"I am going through an overwhelmingly serious mental inexplicable subconscious problem that is driving me crazy in absolute silence so please hear me out!

I'm a third-grade college student, and there's this girl in my class who joined us just this year because she was supposed to make it to 4th grade but she failed and had to restudy the materials she failed at. Anyways

As far as I can remember, ever since I caught sight of her, and I hope I'm not exaggerating but I can say that, she has been living inside my head !!! Like for every single day that I, only, see her for a few moments, my mind keeps replaying those images of her like a movie and this is making me think about her all the damn time! As if she has completely taken over my mind and I've got nothing else to think about. Like the sight of her creates visual images and vocals, when I hear her voice, and they're kept as echoes inside my mind and they stick there and never leave! It's not just some overthinking because this caused lots of impacts on the mental and physical level. Like in addition to that, the amount of fake scenarios about her where I imagined us together are countless which makes me emotional or upset.

I also hear the voices of me talking to other people I know about it or even talking to myself questioning what the h'ck is going on with me. As if my mind is begging for help and wants me to say something. These voices drive me nuts and sometimes they are louder than reality which makes me can't focus on something or on study or during lectures. In addition to that, I'm feeling a weird discomfort and anxiety in my body and esp in my chest like my heart is aching, this happens daily or semi daily at least and for several hours a day and in sudden moments or when I'm extensively thinking. Also for every day that I'd go back home i spend an hour just sitting and doing nothing and start overthinking without any control over it with a disturbed and upset look on me like there's something wrong. That's when I have no will to do anything, and it makes me lose all passion and feel unwilling to do anything. I'm imprisoned by these thoughts, and probably will keep being like that for several hours or the next day.

The amount of negative thoughts made me feel sick. I've become obsessed with this problem and there's a war going in my mind because of this. I'm sure I don't have any other problems in my life that might be the reason because this absolutely never happened to me before and I've been noticing these same symptoms for almost 3 months now.
Like I don't know what to do, this developed a great amount of insecurities and self doubt and thinking that I'm crazy and there's something wrong with me. It's all making everything worse and it's all in a subconscious way and it's so hard for me to express it or admit it even to myself. Like I'm in denial of it. Also, absolutely no human being knows about this because I feel like it's gonna turn into a real problem if I told somebody because I hoped it'd stop suddenly someday but it didn't.

It seems something so addictive like I always try to distract myself from thinking but it would just go back later. The only times I feel sometimes Ok and/or distracted is when listening to music, sleeping or sometimes engaging with someone in a conversation or being in some event I'm interacting with. As if my mind needs a strong distraction to forget her, music did a good job at that because it mostly changed my mood for the better when I felt low. But this is all just temporary like my mind can't let it go, it's not in my hand. I may even think I saw her in my dreams a few times now. A problem that is more annoying is, the images of her in my mind are so blurry as if she's a ghost because I used to always forget her face but still I know I'm thinking about her and feeling something.

It's so crazy like this can't be some kind of random thing from my brain that decided to suddenly like her and think about her because I don't even know her at all! All the being said, I don't not, or try not to, pay attention to her when she's there!

The only thing that I seem to obviously know, is that well, she's ""relatively pretty"", or at least prettier, in a unique way(maybe I'm the only one who sees her like that IDK), she's noticeably shorter than me, also a bit older than me, which yeah it may have mode me feel strongly attracted to her (but I was ignoring that and didn't wanna do anything about it), like her presence makes a difference. it's something I felt for the first time and it didn't happen before. But still this is not an enough reason for all of this to happen and it sounds so negative and insane and it doesn't make sense at all. This can't be just happening because I only see her for 20 seconds a week. The thought of this makes me feel much angry sometimes. It is something that I so much struggle to understand and find an answer to. I know all of this sounds crazy but I guess it's mostly true. At least there's something.

So finally, what do you think? What should I do about it? I need a solution that would stop me from thinking and just make me see her as any other girl, I hope this solution. doesn't include interacting with her in any way.",4,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i8duk3/i_need_a_quick_help_for_the_insanity_im/,joeseph13,1737665923.0,mentalillness

2525,I'm just so tired..,"I guess I don't even know what I'm looking for here. Just a place to get this out, and I hope that's okay.. 
As of late I've been overwhelmingly stressed out. My nerves are shot and I'm extremely depressed. 
I'm 29f and married with two children, one of which is 4 months old, the other is 5.
I quit my job at the beginning of last year due to some serious issues between myself and another coworker, and things escalated, she threatened me, my boss did nothing, so I left. I found out I was pregnant about a month later. My pregnancy was wrought with problems and complications, and I was induced at 37 weeks. My baby spent a week in the NICU before coming home. Baby is fine, that's all good. 
Unbeknownst to me, my mother's mental state had started to deteriorate, and she was having psychiatric issues, which we sort of assumed were due to a medication she had been taking. Hallucinating, delusions, the whole nine.. We made it through the holidays and the new year, and I could tell something was off, but there was nothing I could really do. 
Since then, things has continued to get worse, to the point that I don't want my children to see her that way. My oldest has been asking questions that I don't know how to answer and says that she misses her grandma. It absolutely crushes me every single time.
Obviously no one is at fault here, and I'm not trying to punish my mom by keeping her grandbabies away, but she's so erratic and volatile right now, and it concerns me.
The thing that hit me the hardest was a night when my husband was out with his friends watching a football game, and my dad called me, saying that my mother was convinced that I had taken something the night before and removed myself from the census (you get the concept here). He wanted her to hear my voice and convince her that everything was good. After that phone call, I had completely lost my composure, and have been struggling to keep it together since. My nerves are shot. I'm super anxious all the time and I check in with my dad daily to see how she's doing but things just don't seem to be getting better. 
She was taken off the medication that we had assumed was causing the issue and it's been three weeks since then. I would have thought that things would be improving by now. I just want my mom back..

2526,What can I do to not feel overwhelmed?,"I get overwhelmed easily. I didn't used to.

People don't understand and get annoyed with me. That makes me feel even more overwhelmed and I start to get mad. It causes people to think I'm dramatic. 

I just wish I didn't get these feelings. I've been told I'm choosing it. I wish I could choose to not feel it. It's just an internal feeling of unease.

2536,"Bipolar type unspecified with psychotic symptoms, 46F","I've been in and out of the mental hospital my whole adult life. I am bipolar but I've never had a major depression episode however I do get full blown mania. With mania however I get psychosis which happens every single time. I do see a psychiatrist and psychologist and am medicated.  That's the basic facts but now I'll have to go into my life. 

In 2016 my husband died of cancer.  In 2017 I had a very bad episode, as per usual with psychosis I was having delusions,  paranoia, and hallucinations.  I did damage to the bathroom in the basement and the upstairs bedroom due to that. I dont have any idea how long I was in that state, by then I didnt know if it day or night anymore.  Which by default means my pills were messed up in the process. The cops were eventually called by my neighbors and then my parents were called as well. My parents took me in. I ended up in the mental hospital for a month. When I  was in there my parents had me sign papers I am now both a ward and they have power of attorney.  I was then put in a group home type of thing for a year when released. In my opinion this was completely unnecessary. To add insult to injury my pets were rehomed due to everything.  I also wasnt allowed to return to my house. 

Since 2018 I have lived on my own in my apartment.  However my mother handles the Bill's. And my dad handles my medication. By this point I dont know what the hell to do because I know had I if been with it at the time, I'd of never of signed those papers.  In my opinion the whole incident of mine scared them so much they will never give me control of my life back. 

To make matters  worse I've been on disability for 10 years due to the above condition and I cant afford a car. I also dont have friends irl. So I'm semi stuck in the apartment like it or not most of the time,  this leads to being naturally depressed it has little to do with being bipolar.

I just want a normal life back. And I dont see a way to obtain that without my rights. If I choose to go to court over it odds are the psychiatrist wont back me upstairs but the psychologist might. It doesn't help that I know these kinds of cases are rarely reversed unless the guardian steps down willingly.  My only other option is to remarry and give him the control. But that will mess with my finances due to disability and still being on my late husbands medical insurance,  which I'll lose if I remarry. 

I've tried to bring it up, my mom agrees that at some point theyll have to turn over control but not yet. They're clearly just too scared to do it. They're also 69 years old and not in the best of health so them dying is also a factor she did agree she wants things turned over before that might happen,  but they're still not willing to. I simply dont know what to do anymore.

2538,Losing a Sister to Bipolar,"I sit by the phone, dreading the next call. It could be her, speaking in a voice I barely recognize, her words disjointed and fueled by an energy that doesn’t feel like her own. Or it could be someone else—a friend, a coworker, maybe even the police—telling me about her latest episode. The sister I grew up with, the one who used to braid my hair and dress me up in the latest fashion trends, feels like a ghost now, eclipsed by a disease that has taken control of her life.

It wasn’t always like this. She used to be a beacon of stability and grace, the glue that held our family together. She was proud of her career. Her marriage was strong, built on years of love and mutual respect. She always wanted to be a mother, the kind who made every birthday magical and every scraped knee feel like a rite of passage. She took pride in it all. And now, piece by piece, she’s destroying it.

She starts speaking faster than usual, jumping from one topic to another with a fervor that is exhausting. “I’m fine,” she insisted when I asked if she needed help. “I’ve just been working a lot. You know how it is.” But it wasn’t just work. Soon, there were sleepless nights, impulsive decisions, and conflicts with her husband that seemed to come out of nowhere. Her children began to retreat, confused and scared by the change in their once-steady mother.

The mania makes her feel invincible, untouchable, and reckless. I keep hoping that she will find her way back to us. But the reality has been far more complicated. Medication is a fragile balancing act.

Now, I watch helplessly as she dismantles everything she once loved. Her career—the one she worked so hard to build—is in shambles after she lost her job in a dramatic and public display. Her marriage is strained to the breaking point; her husband looks at her now with a mix of love and despair. Her children don’t understand why Mommy’s moods swing so wildly, why she’s sometimes the life of the party and other times a storm they have to weather.

The worst part is that I don’t recognize her voice anymore. It’s louder, sharper, filled with grandiose ideas and unfounded accusations. She’s convinced that everyone is against her, especially me. I try to reach her, but my words bounce off an invisible wall that her mania has built around her.

I feel so powerless. I’ve read every book, joined every support group, and tried to educate myself on how to help her. But nothing prepares you for the raw pain of watching someone you love spiral out of control. People tell me to set boundaries, to protect myself, but how do you protect yourself from the ache of losing someone who’s still alive? How do you reconcile the person she was with the person she’s become?

She is fighting a battle I can’t fully understand.

I want to believe she’ll come back to us. That the right combination of medication, therapy, and support will help her reclaim her life. But until then, all I can do is stand by, holding onto the fragments of the sister I knew, hoping against hope that one day, she’ll find her way back to herself—and to us.",5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i7m8lu/losing_a_sister_to_bipolar/,Zestyclose_Heat2397,1737580626.0,mentalillness
2539,A childhood of abuse to a future of terminal cancer,"Once, there was a woman who spent her life dreaming of recreating a childhood she never had. From the moment she could form thoughts, she knew that the world she was given was filled with darkness. A mother who couldn’t love, who only knew how to hurt with words and hands. The warmth of a nurturing embrace was a foreign concept, and she spent her childhood searching for something that might resemble love, something that could heal the wounds of neglect and abuse.

She vowed that one day, when she had her own children, she would be different. She would be the mother she had never had. A mother who loved unconditionally, a mother whose arms were always open for comfort, whose words built her child up instead of tearing them down. She envisioned her home filled with laughter, art, adventure, and all the things she missed out on—fairy tales read at night, warm hugs after bad dreams, and a safety net for when life was hard.

She married and had a beautiful daughter who was the center of her world. The little girl was everything the woman had hoped for, a living embodiment of love, innocence, and joy. She did everything in her power to give her child a world free from the pain she’d known. She worked tirelessly to break the cycle, to build a life that would offer her daughter the security, warmth, and joy that she had never known herself.

But as life often does, it threw an unthinkable curveball. She was diagnosed with breast cancer. The words fell heavy on her heart, like a thousand stones. She had already overcome so much, and now, after all the years spent dreaming and fighting for a better life for her daughter, the world felt like it was crumbling beneath her feet. Even after all the treatment to beat the odds, a few years later, the cancer returned—this time, it was terminal.

As her body weakened, her heart ached for her daughter. The thought of leaving her child behind filled her with an insurmountable sorrow. She had spent so many years trying to create a safe haven for her daughter, and now, the woman would be gone too soon to see her blossom into the person she was meant to be. The memories they had shared—the bedtime stories, the hugs, the simple joy of being together—would be all her daughter would have left.

She never wanted her to feel the pain of being motherless, the hole in her heart that had never healed for herself. She thought of how her daughter would grow up without the one person who loved her completely, without the mother who would guide her through life’s challenges. It was more than she could bear.

But as the days passed and she reflected on her life, she realized something profound. Perhaps the love she had given her daughter—the love that had been so absent in her own life—was already enough. Her daughter had known love. She had known safety. She had known the joy of a mother who gave everything to make sure she never felt abandoned or unloved. And while the woman may not be there to witness her daughter’s future, she had already given her the greatest gift: a childhood free from trauma, filled with memories that would live on in her daughter's  heart.

The woman knew her time was short, but she held onto the hope that her daughter would carry forward the love, kindness, and strength she had instilled in her. The memories they had would live on—every bedtime story, every embrace, every moment of joy. The woman was leaving, but she was leaving a legacy of love that would forever shape her daughter’s life.

In her final days, she closed her eyes with peace in her heart, knowing that her dream of rewriting her own childhood had been realized through the life she had given her daughter. Even though she wouldn't be there to share in her daughter's milestones, her love would remain, an everlasting presence in every moment that her daughter would live, for as long as she had breath to take. And that, she realized, was the greatest victory of all.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i7msmo/a_childhood_of_abuse_to_a_future_of_terminal/,Zestyclose_Heat2397,1737582033.0,mentalillness

2541,Not sure how much more I can take tbh,"The list goes on and on of things that keep adding up and making my life terrible. Mostly it's from my own choices but the mental illness aspect is omnipresent, as most of you know. 

I'm diagnosed schizo-effective and even with meds, supplements, diet, distractions, nothing seems to work long term. Usually I have to experience a LOT of good things to just make a dent in my internal experience and now I am seeing through that, which doesn't make things better, only worse. I honestly wish I had a wish to just heal every sick person (including myself) but that is, of course, impossible. It's hard to see the light when there is so much darkness.

2542,Does this sound like BPD?,"
does this sound like BPD?

Husbands behavior which is why I wanted to discuss borderline personality disorder when husband returned from work this afternoon his behavior was relatively normal despite the fact he had purchased alcohol and had started drinking. He went outside to mow the lawn and after about 20 min I noticed husband  was driving erratically on the mower and noticed he had started to run over our citrus trees planted in our back yard, I knew at this moment something had been triggered and he was turning. He continued to drive erratically and ran into our water tank outside and busted a hole in it. He then continued to mow over the water that was spilling out and do burn outs and skids in the water when I went out to check on the water tank and find out what he was doing he looked straight through me and continued to mow moving the mower over closer to my feet before driving off. He continued to do this for 10 min whilst driving throwing his hands and feet up in the air and throwing his head back. He has also mentioned today that he thinks his medication induced ticks have returned as he previously had them when he was a child. He said he wishes to not continue on them. This is a snap shot of husband erratic behavior and how quickly he can snap. Even without alcohol he is very quick tempered and easily triggered

Does this sound like BPD? This is what I witnessed this afternoon and emailed his psychiatrist…

2543,In need of help for all my issues and I don’t know where to begin,"I don’t really know where to start with this, but this is just an alt account as I don’t want anyone to see this. A bit about me: I’m an 18-year-old male residing in Canada and originally from North Africa. As mentioned earlier, I don’t know where to begin, so I’ll take things one part at a time.

I was born in Egypt and lived half my life there. For the other half, I have been living in Canada. I have two loving parents who I know care for me very much, but ever since I was little, my mom has been critically ill—even to the point of near death at times. My dad was always worried and taking care of her, so I didn’t get to see them often. After school in Egypt, I would go to my grandmother’s or grandfather’s house and stay there until my parents came home from work around 8 p.m. They would pick me up, and we’d go home, spend some time together until 10 p.m., and then the cycle would repeat. I am not complaining at all; in fact, I thank God, as my situation could have been much worse.

However, not having my parents around much meant I didn’t learn how to study or work hard at a young age. Instead, I was mostly pampered by my grandparents. This is where I think my first problem began: I can’t really focus or push myself to do much, especially when it comes to schoolwork. It’s not because I’m stupid, but because I find it hard to apply myself.

When we moved to Canada, we thought things would get better, but my mother was diagnosed with the same illness again. She was sick for almost four years, one of which she spent constantly in and out of the ICU. Thankfully, I was able to spend more time with my parents after moving, but their experiences have made them fragile when it comes to stress and anger. They snap easily, and I don’t blame them—I know I haven’t seen even a fraction of what they’ve endured. Still, this makes it hard to talk to them, especially my dad. He has a short temper, and sadly, we argue and bicker a lot. Despite this, I love him deeply, and I know he loves me just as much.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t focus in school as I’m in grade 12, and I’m struggling to even pass certain classes. I used to be a top student, but now I’m always lazy and procrastinating. I compare myself to others and feel inadequate. My room is always a mess because I can never bring myself to clean it or do anything productive. I really, really need help in this area. I feel hopeless and don’t know how to find the motivation to study or apply myself to anything that requires effort in my life.

Another major issue I am struggling with is pornography and masturbation. I really want to quit. I’m very close to my religion, which I love deeply, and I want to overcome this for two main reasons: to better myself as a person and to prepare for my future wife. I was raised in the church and hold my faith close to my heart, but I feel like this issue is holding me back from living up to my beliefs and values.

Speaking of my future wife, I met a girl about a year and a half ago, and I’ve fallen head over heels for her. I think I genuinely love her. I want to change all these things so I can become the best version of myself for her. She is the complete opposite of me: always studying, consistent with the gym, and always pushing herself. I know she deserves better than me, and I understand how tiring it must be for her to always try to help and push me. I feel guilty because she’s everything I want to be, and I feel like I’m dragging her down. I really want to change for both myself and her, but I feel like it’s too late for me, and I need help.

On top of all of this, I’ve been slacking in my spiritual life as well. My religion is very important to me, and I was practically raised in my church. It’s where I met most of my friends and found a sense of community, but lately, I’ve been neglecting this part of my life too.

Overall, I really, really want to change, but I don’t know where to start or how to begin. Even writing this took a lot out of me because I lack motivation, but I know I need to do this for myself. I want to get rid of laziness, stop procrastinating, and become a better version of myself. Please, I need help.

2544,I don’t know how to move forward and get help,"TW eating disorder, self harm, 

Basically what the title says. I know I’m unwell, but due to past actions I have no idea how to move forward from them to help myself. My apologies if this isn’t coherent or just plain messy to read, im just trying to get it out at the moment.

I’m a 16 year old girl that has diagnosed anxiety and suspected depression, but that’s honestly all. I went through a time in my life (late 2022- early 2023) where I was an extremely aggressive and sometimes violent person. I would often start arguments with my parents most days, and while looking back I’m not 100% sure why, I believe it to be partially because it was a way to get my emotions out. I know that isn’t an excuse for a child to act like that, but it’s the only reasoning I can find for why I acted that way. There were even times when they threatened to call the police on me, because of how I was acting, and looked into boarding schools so I would be away more, as to not tear the family apart. (Screaming at them during arguments at 10/11pm, multiple times a week)

During this time in my life, I did self harm quite a bit, and often after these arguments. It wasn’t anything severe, but I would still hurt myself so I guess it still counts. My parents never found out about this. Not sure what happened after this time, but I found myself coming out of how I was acting after a few months, much to my parents relief. The last few years we would argue every so often, but it would be resolved pretty quickly. This brings us to now.

Within the last six months or so, I’ve started to get bad again. In July I almost got kicked out of the house by my father because I caught the bus home from school 2 and a half hours early, as I had a panic attack at school and he wouldn’t pick me up. When I got home (at about 1pm) he told me to ‘pack my shit’ because he was going to take me to the police station, and put me in resi care or something. It didn’t end up happening as my mum talked him out of it, but it was a lot at the time. Since then we’ve been arguing a lot more, and I can tell it’s getting bad again. My mental health has been deteriorating again this year and I’ve started self harming again. My eating has gotten worse and I’ve been essentially starving myself, only eating once a day usually, and small things. 

I know I need help, and I’ve tried to speak to my parents about it a few times but due to how I was in 2022, they’ve essentially ‘given up trying to help me’ because they tried for months back then, and I just never did anything with it. I know how I acted back then was terrible and I can’t fix it now, but I’m scared if I don’t get help that I’ll end up getting worse and worse. I just don’t know what to do because of how broken the relationship is with my parents.

2547,Do you fear that you will hurt someone physically,"Do you ever worry that you will hurt someone mentally or even worse physically.

I have Bipolar disorder and because of this I have a lot of trouble controlling my emotions and intense anger issues. 

I just saw a tiktok and about a a situation where this couple was in a normal healthy relationship for several years until one day the wife started doing creepy shit like staring at her husband creepily constantly until one day she was staring at him under the bed with glass in her hand and it was even cutting her hands but but when he tried to help her she stabbed him. She ended up in a psychiatric facility. I honestly don’t even wanna talk about this because I feel like it’s bad juju, I just get really bad vibes from the story but.

My point is, I’ve been psychotic before and it will happen again, and it’s different every time so literally nobody knows what could happen. I have zero desire to physically hurt someone but I feel like there’s a possibility something like this could happen and if I’m psychotic and there’s no telling what I could do and I literally would have zero control over it. 

Even when I wasn’t psychotic I did violent acts out of anger. Kicking holes in walls, breaking doors, I threw a folding chair at a glass sliding door once and thankfully the door didn’t break but you catch my drift? I’m not trying to blame it all on bipolar but if I wasn’t bipolar I would probably have a much easier time regulating my emotions and I feel like this kind of stuff wouldn’t happen.

2549,"Need some serious help (psychosis, NPD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) because of LSD idk what it is lmao","I was taking LSD (a psychedelic) every other day for maybe four to five months during 2021. I had grown comfortable taking it because I always prided myself for having ""control"" over it whereas my friends, who would occasionally have bad trips taking it, were sensitive towards the drug.

For context, and this is important, I had been smoking weed since the early age of 13 and did a lot of MDMA when I was 17. When my Mom had passed away, I decided to sober up and turn my life around, which I did.
My story was so inspiring, friends and people I did not know thought that I was going to be the next President, which | believed, considering how passionate | was about politics and helping people out. Anyways, this streak of sobriety lasted for maybe a year and a half.
And when I entered college, began smoking weed again due to the excitement of being introduced to a culture that I believed I could easily adapt to

This is when the story gets interesting, and maybe even the cause of my downfall.
I had met a pretty girl in my class. Let's just say that I grew to become obsessed over her, and although she already expressed rejection and discomfort towards me (as I would constantly like her posts on social media, and due to my reputation during the time, would insinuate, at least according to her, that there was something going on between us), I took it as a sign of motivation to keep on going for her and not accept being rejected. Anyways, after that, she blocked me on Facebook.: forward to 2021, I was doing a lot of LSD like how 1 V introduced at the start of this post. For some reason, it hit me really hard, like really really hard.

I developed intense grandiose thoughts of me actually believing | could be the President, other than me believing I was the living reincarnation of Jesus Christ. For me, it didn't matter what other people thought, because I believed what I believed in regardless of what others thought, even my family. I had dwelled into the compliments and admiration of my peers due to past accolades that I didn't get to understand anymore that that wasn't the case, as my behavior, attitude, and mentality totally changed when I had developed these grandiose thoughts. More than this, I began exhibiting odd behaviors. I was talking to myself, listening to music constantly (I would put my phone speaker beside my ear) which my family and friends found weird because were earphones for, right? And I would walk around in the middle of the night at my home doing this off behavior.

Anyways, every time I would see the girl on social media in a mutual friend's account, I would believe that these mutual friends were ""teasing"" me to like her. In my mind, I believed that she was orchestrating all these hang outs with our mutual friends to tease me, which of course wasn't the case. These ""hang outs"" would happen probably for 4-5 months. And the grandiose thoughts didn't stop.

It got worse during the first quarter of 2022.
I had begun posting these odd political related posts on my social media and people noticed that it wasn't me (1 used to be very sharp and acute when it came to my political positions but these were just plain emotional and stupid). In my mind, I would fantasize that she was going to be my wife and the First Lady. It reached a point that everything I would see on social media I would think would be directed towards me (I woula formulate a reasoning behind what people would be posting about).

My schizophrenia at this point reached its peak. I began messaging her friends, even her ex, about how I was so obsessed with her and if I could visit her at her home. I even brought my siblings to watch her brother's concert where her whole family was present (it was so fuckin weird and awkward I dont know why I did that).

Anyways, things began to stop when I got to talk to my family about my behavior, we didn't talk about the girl, but we talked about these odd behaviors that they were noticing and I was able to quit it out. I had learned that when busy, I tend to stray away from these grandiose thoughts and odd behaviors. Fast forward to 2024. I had still been smoking a lot of weed, but took LSD again during the first quarter of 2024. After maybe three years.
The schizophrenia hit again. This time it was much worse.

I created a social media account, stealing photos of my friends, her and her family, even people I don't know personally but were close to her, and I would post these political captions that would correlate to my delusional thoughts of me and her being together, it was schizophrenia and delusion at its finest. She and her family wanted to report me to the police. But because my sister talked to her, and my Dad talked to her Mother, they realized that it was a mental condition and did not want to burden my family's situation with what was happening to me.

I went to therapy, and decided to quit drugs forever (a really big step in my opinion, considering how my older 27 year old brother does a lot of drugs too). I believe I've reached a very low point in my life because of these experiences. I find a hard time forgiving myself, and accepting this. Who I am now is very different from who I was before in probably all aspects of life possible.

I need help.

I have past issues that i’ve healed from(SA, toxic relationship, old friends that did me dirty, poverty, depression, eating disorders, all that) but mostly i’ve healed, or i am too busy to think about them anymore.
I have a really dysfunctional family: i m 100% my mom has undiagnosed bpd, my dad, we ll talk later about him, my sister who all my life did me dirty etc.
I am totally on my own, not a soul to talk to or someone to at least understand me.
I am mostly an A to +A student, i work with kids, and they all love me so i have a satisfaction from my success.I am also a gym rat and my gym progress makes me feel confident enough to navigate through life at 20 yo.
I have a bf,20M, that i love but there are some downsides to our rs as well.
He quit college, the same university of engineering that i was attending and his mom was totally fine with that, even offered to pay his tuition to another university.
Here it goes, i am admitting it finally, i hate this.I am totally uncomfortable for him being so dependent on his parents, and his parents always supporting him.He has the same job as me because his mother own the Afterschool we work at.He receives money from his family, support, everything .
I had to make my own money since i was 12 because my mom is so negligent and my dad couldn’t care less about my wishes.I have to work 2 jobs while he has all the time in the world for only working like me 2 days a week and another 2 hours everyday.
My sister has 2 kids and she s a Stay at home mom, my parents cover all the utilities since we own the house, and she hasn’t worked since 2021.
While i have to run there and there, to make some money to support my dreams into becoming an biomedical engineer, where no one even cared to support me.When i was in HS, i finished first in my class and my parents didn’t even care to support me in college.Initially, i wanted to go to med school, but my mother said that i have to get a job because they wouldn’t help me.In my country you can’t work if you go to med school, is too hard.So i choose engineering.
With my realisation, with the fact that i am totally succeeding because of my hard work, i m content.I am proud of myself, i work really hard and study even harder to get where i want.But i would like a shoulder to cry on when things get really heavy, because they do.They really do after so many years of trauma and all that..My dad, now about him, he had cancer, he survived thankfully but growing up he ruined my self esteem and he wasn’t much present, i feel like we all love him now because he went through what he went through.He is a really hard working man, i have this trait from him, but he was absent.But nevertheless, my mom is worse, narcissistic and abusing.They don’t even know at what college i m going.I stay at their place 3 times a week and the rest at my bf s place.I have no place to escape, i can’t hide anywhere to have peace of mind…

My mother was neglective, my father was incredibly abusive, and I have a little brother with special needs, who received all of the attention.

I didn’t have any friends, I didn’t have anybody I could go to or get the love I desperately craved. I always relied on my stuff animals and daydreaming to keep me going.

Life didn’t get any better growing up, I was sexually molested and assaulted on multiple occasions, groomed by a man who I thought loved me, and grew into selling my body just to be praised and told that I was loved.

I’m eighteen now, and I don’t feel like i’ve grown. I don’t want to grow up, I just want to be loved, held, and taken care of like a child. I desperately crave a father that will love me, but i’ll never have it.

I have a boyfriend, who i’ve told about this, but it just isn’t the same.

Watching someone bang their head on the ground and throw a pillow across the room will do that.

But I still feel like I'm missing an essential part of the college experience. The college life. It's more than just getting a degree. That's what I've heard anyway. I don't want to be even more isolated. I just want a normal college experience. An experience that someone who isn't ""sick"" would have. I want to try a roommate.

2555,Do I have narcissism issues,"Do I have narcissism issues

I feel like I’m such an asshole because I keep comparing myself to other girls and even my own friends, I’ve caught my mind subconsciously thinking that I’m prettier or that I’m better than them because of how they look or how they act, obviously I never said those things out loud because it’s in my subconscious. I don’t actually find them “ugly” or whatever in any case but sometimes I just can’t help it but compare their attractiveness to mines. When I see pretty girls all I can think is that I have more personality than them or some other shit to convince myself I’m the better one, I’m so fucking insecure and jealous of girls who are more attractive than me and it’s killing me because I feel like such a horrible person for comparing myself to my friends and for even thinking things like “I look better” or “I’m the prettier friend” The thing is I’m not even pretty and I swear I don’t find them ugly or anything and isn’t picking out my friends based on attraction but it’s just in my subconscious and I want to stop but I just can’t, I see all the girls on social media and I find comfort/relief in the posts of those who look “unattractive” and get insanely insecure over those who look good. I feel like I’m a fucking narcissist but at the same time I’m so damn insecure and it’s killing me, the worst part is I can’t control it no matter how hard I try I just compare myself with others, and I can’t stop it I don’t know what’s even wrong with me",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i7frvj/do_i_have_narcissism_issues/,Ok_Look6594,1737565010.0,mentalillness

2559,I hate that my sibling is better than me,"Hello, I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, but I need to vent about something that has been bothering me for a while now.

To contextualize a little, when I was younger I was very good at physics and had the best grades in my English class. These two things were my pride, so much so that they were the only things I could trully lean on at the time. Fast-forward to today, my younger sibling beat me in these two things. They´re currently studying something closely related to physics in their university. Due to a series of events I couldn´t achieve to study my dream major. Aditionally, today we got the results for the Cambridge C1 exam. I passed with a C while my sibling passed with an A. Both of the things I loved doing got taken away. I don´t know what to do. My sibling is both smarter and more good-looking than me. Also, they´re way more empathetic and have a better personality than I. I feel like a total failure.

I often try to gaslight myself into thinking that I´m better than them at other things, but that might also turn out to be a lie the moment our abilities are put to the test.

I don´t hate my sibling, I´m just mad at myself for not reaching that level. I want to be at least as good as them.",11,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i6urzr/i_hate_that_my_sibling_is_better_than_me/,Spiritual_Bread5592,1737497204.0,mentalillness

I'll feel great one moment then despair the next /Anxiety, sadness, paranoia etc.... so bad that i feel it pshycally chest hurting, skin burning daily) I get overly attached to partners. I don't get angry with them or hate them but i cannot stand to be apart from them. Too clingy/dependent (what are they doing? are they going to leave me? are they cheating on me? watching porn?) .

And when i'm single it seems to be no better i hate being alone. but also like being alone. Friendships are hard for me because i don't like going out often and after social events i come home and cry even if i did have a great time.

2564,Am I normal?,"I don’t exactly know what to title this, I guess it is sort of a vent but I need people to respond and give me advice if possible, if you think I fit into some type of disorder or whatever that I should bring up with my therapist, I don’t know.

I am 16 M. I’ve struggled with feeling real empathy or remorse towards things for a while, I don’t completely NOT feel it, I do feel things like guilt and remorse and empathy sometimes, but hardly. I don’t not feel emotions, in fact I tend to experience emotions strongly, like either all or nothing if that makes sense.
However, in many cases, when apologizing to someone or providing comfort I know im not being truthful. I have to put on a mask almost, and act as if I’m really sorry for a situation someone else is in. Sometimes I’ll feel bad for something that I have caused, but that’s mainly centered around how what I have done would affect me. I do not really feel for other people at all. A lot of my friends come to me for comfort, and I do my best to comfort them not because I feel bad but because it feels like what I am required to do as a friend. Which I’m not against. Many things I do, like a casual “oh I’m sorry” to something or comforting, just feels like habits I’ve had to learn to fit easier into society if that makes sense. I do enjoy being close to people, I value things like that.

I get extremely angry and irritated very easily, but maybe that’s just a hormone thing. I haven’t really been physically violent with people before, I don’t think I’m that irresponsible or impulsive. I’d like to say I’m more calculated with the things I do. I’d like to say strategic? I think of stuff as a game. Where I just have to make all the right moves, be smart, and people will once again be by my side. I know how to appease to people to be on their good side.

2569,Unique psychological case with no definite cure.,"My sister is 21 years old and has very low consciousness. Although she is medically normal and has no diagnosed physical or mental condition, she lacks motivation, goals, self-esteem, and empathy. She doesn't take any initiative in life, and everything has to be spoon-fed to her. Despite being an adult, she has not matured emotionally or mentally and is only 4’10” in height.

She is extremely lazy and stubborn, and her behavior has become a burden to our family. She has no plans for her future, doesn't listen to others, and shows no embarrassment or sense of accountability for her actions. She seems to operate on basic instincts, much like an animal: she wakes up, seeks dopamine all day, and then sleeps. She lacks empathy and doesn't care about the consequences of her actions on others. Even after repeated attempts to correct her behavior, including therapy, medication, and disciplinary actions, there has been no improvement.

While she appears to be a normal, introverted person to outsiders, at home, her behavior is entirely different. She often makes poor choices and has minimal knowledge about anything, despite being raised in an open-minded family and attending the best schools and colleges. She has no friends, no emotional intelligence, and no ability to control her impulses.
She also exhibits extremely inappropriate behaviors. For instance, she has been caught masturbating beside me and frequently mimics or imitates actions from TV in an exaggerated and strange manner. She also has weird kinks, which add to the complexity of her behavior. Her actions often provoke anger and frustration in others, seemingly on purpose, as if to elicit reactions. 

She is a puppet to her surroundings, easily influenced but showing no initiative of her own. Her entire day revolves around seeking momentary pleasure, with no regard for responsibilities or the impact of her actions. She cannot control her emotions, making her behavior unpredictable and disruptive. 
Despite every effort—therapies, medications, or changes in how we treat her—nothing has worked. She is entirely dependent on us for guidance and survival, yet she resists all attempts to help her improve. We feel stuck as her behavior continues to be a burden, and her lack of progress or interest in changing herself makes the situation worse. 

My sister’s brain cannot process any kind of complexity. She struggles to do even basic tasks, making her unable to contribute or help in any way. Despite this, she refuses to try anything herself and expects everything to be handed to her. Outsiders might think we are being harsh with her, but the reality is that my parents constantly have to monitor and manage her life. She won’t take food on her own and has to be served. She has never cooked anything for herself and needs to be forced to drink water, wear different clothes, go outside, or stop watching TV.

My mother even has to bathe her because once she goes into the bathroom, she doesn’t come out on her own. My mom’s life has become so centered around taking care of her that she cannot enjoy her own life. This constant frustration often leads her to hit my sister to make her cooperate and complete basic tasks.
She is good in nothing and unskilled in everything, she has no hobbies or anything, just eat sleep entertainment. Her life experiences are of a 6 year old. She is so many times told by everyone she says yes at that time, and still behaves same, consequence of having no self esteem. Like she doesn’t even flex a little and mostly does the opposite. Like we are upper middle class, but if you ask her our description, you will think we are lower middle class. She has only one poor friend who uses her. She embarrasses the whole family

My sister seems to enjoy watching conflicts at home, especially between my mom and dad, as it gives her the freedom to do as she pleases, like watching TV, without anyone monitoring her. Sometimes, I even have to control her phone and restrict her access. After watching even low-quality, lighthearted content, she starts acting lost and caught up in a dreamy, unrealistic world. She occasionally tries to trigger fights between my parents, and most arguments in the house are caused by her. For example, my father blames my mom for hitting her, while my mom argues back, saying he should take responsibility for handling her instead. My father, being short-tempered, often engages in loud verbal arguments, but my sister remains unfazed.

She sometimes seems to deliberately force us to discipline her physically because she won’t listen otherwise, even for simple things. For instance, even if we are busy or in a hurry, we have to wait for her to do something basic like moving from one place to another, hurrying up, completing a small task, or engaging in self-care. No matter how much we shout, she won’t cooperate until she’s physically reprimanded. This has become a routine. She never cries or holds grudges after being beaten; it seems like a normal part of her life. She is both emotionally and physically stubborn, making it extremely difficult to manage her daily needs or behavior.

Backstory - she was born as a frail child, she was in ICU for few months, she was very quite all her childhood, she used to shit in her pants till she was 9 years old and wouldnt even tell anyone, so she had no friends because of smell. She had once pissed herself in middle of road , when she was 16-17, i dunno why she couldnt go to toilet. She had very less height so she had to take hormone injections for 3-4 years, and she used to inject easily, she is not afraid mostly of ghosts or anything because she is mindless or in her own world most times. The best option was to put her in hostel, but she would have killed herself , she cannot do her own things, even her periods are managed by mom. She doesnt think of past or future. Those who have lived with her only know that she has problem. She even troubles my grandparents by ordering them things and sitting at one place. 

We dunno how her marriage will happen or what job she will do. 
She is not even mental, she generally seem normal in public. I never had a normal brother - sister relationship. My mom started going to temples and all , so she also says that she has problem and god will change it, she doesnt realise her fate is in her hands. Not that she has faith in god or anything, she doesnt care, just because my mon says she also says.
I am exactly opposite to her, i am 17 yo, overthinker, want to become successful, knowledge obssessed, empathetic, skilled, love sports, etc, we are opposite in each and every thing. People think that she is just naive, but she has no opinion of her own on anything, she never did critical thinking, her iq is low too. I always felt for her, even if she herself didnt, but never found a solution. 
How can we make her understand on her own without forcing her. She is all ok with scoldings and beating whole day but she just wants rest.

HELP ME PLEASE.

And we are Indians so parents have to take care of their children till they are actually independent cause outside world could be scary for women.

2570,Does anyone else feel instinctive repulsion to phrases from psychotherapists like “take responsibility for your life”?,"I know this post will mostly receive negative reactions (like my previous post on this topic), but I really need to find like-minded people right now, so I am willing to endure this discomfort if, among the sea of triggering and depressive comments with advice to *“take responsibility for your life”*, there'll be at least a few words of support.

Phrases from psychologists or psychotherapists like *“take responsibility for your life”* feel like pure evil to me. I cannot express how deeply repulsed I am by such words and how depressed I feel when I hear something like that (I mean in this psychotherapeutic context, as I have nothing against the concept of legal or moral responsibility). This is literally one of the top three things I hate most in the world. The phrase *“take responsibility for your life”* sounds like blaming (you should blame yourself if something goes wrong), and this is not just my subjective perception, as this meaning of the word *“responsibility”* is documented in dictionaries (see my previous post with examples). So please, don’t tell me nonsense like *“responsibility and blame are different things”*, because that’s objectively not true.

Also, phrases like *“responsibility for your life”* carry an undertone of strictness. It sounds like a demand to be strict with yourself. This word has a clear legal and criminal connotation. When people say *“take responsibility for your life”*, to me, it sounds like a demand to treat myself as if I were some kind of criminal who must be held (criminally) responsible. Such phrases sound like a demand to split my psyche into two parts, one playing the role of the judge and the other sitting in the defendant’s chair.

My former psychotherapist (whom I last saw 13 years ago) constantly talked about *“responsibility for your life”*. I suffer from quite a severe complex mental disorder with numerous symptoms that I’ve suffered from since adolescence, which means for more than half my life. As a result of the “therapy” with that sadistic therapist, I started feeling worse than before. My symptoms worsened, my anxiety intensified, and my relationships with people deteriorated. I asked him not to say such things about *“responsibility”* to me, but he kept doing it even after I explained to him how bad I feel when he says such things.

In my teenage years, my life’s credo was the phrase from Terminator 2: *“There is no fate but what we make for ourselves”* (I can’t guarantee the accuracy of this phrase because I watched the film translated into my native language, but I think most of you remember it). Initially, this helped me, but over time, it gradually turned into a mental disorder with an intense sense of guilt and responsibility. If there's no fate except what I choose, it means I am to blame or responsible for everything that happens in my life. Gradually, such views (among other things) contributed to severe OCD symptoms centered around the pursuit of complete control over myself and things in my life. I experience strong distress when I feel like I lose control over something. Even now, at the age of 41, I feel guilty when I'm resting and not doing something that feels useful (even though I rationally understand that I shouldn’t feel guilty for this). I’m trying not to do this anymore (thanks in part to my new therapy), but I used to have a habit of exhausting myself with various tasks to the point of complete physical and mental burnout. I had working days lasting 25 or even 28 hours straight (UPD: Someone in my previous post called it *""hyperbolic rhetoric""*, so I want to clarify: it's not an exaggeration. Maybe it's not technically correct to call them ""days"" as they actually started on one day and finished on another, but that is what really happened.).

Now, thanks in part to my new psychotherapist (who never triggers me or talks about *“responsibility for your life”*), I feel significantly better — I no longer push myself to such extremes, I feel less guilty about resting, and I accept the loss of control over things and my own imperfections more calmly.

In the comments to my previous post about how the phrase *“take responsibility for your life”* triggers me, a few people, for some reason, decided to start convincing me that I can influence my life, have control over it, be proactive, and so on, including in relation to psychological problems. But I don’t need this explained to me — I already know that. I constantly work on my psychological issues, both with my therapist and on my own. Besides working with my therapist, I try to dedicate time to reading psychotherapeutic literature. When I cook or do housework, I listen to YouTube videos on psychological topics to make productive use of that time. I don’t go out much nowadays (I work from home), but when I used to commute, I always tried to use every free moment (in transport, waiting for something, etc) to read psychological and philosophical literature. But I don’t understand why other people insist that I must label all of this with this evil word “responsibility,” which has an obvious accusatory connotation. This word provokes anxiety, sometimes to the point where I feel like I don't want to live.

**If anyone who reads this post also feels an instinctive repulsion to phrases from psychotherapists like “take responsibility for your life,” please write about it in the comments. It will help me feel better and less depressed.** But if you want to say something in the vein of *“yes, but”* or ""*you misunderstood""*, then please don’t write anything. Just skip this post. And especially, please don’t say anything about how I should *""take responsibility for my life""* or be more active etc. Thank you — I’ve already received enough of those comments to my previous post, and I don’t need any more.",7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i6bmg3/does_anyone_else_feel_instinctive_repulsion_to/,StrikingExplorer4111,1737437583.0,mentalillness

2573,I Want To Harm My Brother. Help,"I've never really used Reddit before, but I want to rant about something. The title makes me sound like some crazy bitch, but the title is true. Everyday I look at my brother, and fantasise about harming him. It's silly little things like if he talks to me in a rude tone, or simply asks me a question. We recently moved to a different country entirely, and it's gotten worse now. We moved without our dad, it's just me, my brother, and my mom... My dad has OCD, and kept our old house very clean, but without him, I feel completely disgusted with my life. It's weird, I never really liked my dad. He would have outbursts often, call our mom slurs, and threaten to hit me or my brother, but it was usually my brother who was threatened to be hit. I don't feel anything at the fact he was left in a different country. Nothing. If anything, I'm glad. The only thing I feel he was good for was keeping our old house clean. He's trying to move out to the country we now live, but in all honesty, I dread the day it happens. We moved to this old house in an even older town. It reminds me of a town you'd see in the old west 300 years ago, which is vastly different from where I used to live. I just don't fit in here. This house is riddled with mold and dirty dishes and clothes, my room is the only place I fear is truly clean. My hygiene habits have gotten worse because of this place. Whenever I brush my teeth, all I can smell is blocked sewage from our sinks, the shower has mold behind the plaster, so we can only get rid of it if we get a professional, which we don't have the money for. My brother is meant to do the dishes and take out the trash, basically clean the kitchen is his whole chore. Yet, I find myself doing those chores at 5AM. before school because he just doesn't. He's a lazy, arrogant bastard. He's made me late for school multiple times because he wakes up right before we leave. My mom will wake him an hour before school, yet he never fails to go back to sleep straight after. When we get home, he'll open a can of soda and sit on the couch watching TV. I'll ask him to do his chores before mom gets home, but he ignores me and acts like he can't hear me. If I remind him one too many times, his eyes will go wide and he'll look at me as if trying to intimidate me. It never works. I laugh at him, but all I can really think is how much better life would be without him. My brother has anger issues and ADHD, for which he's not being medicated for. My mom also has ADHD, and I have OCD as well as being tested for autism. My grandpa, dad, and me all have OCD, which seems to be inherited from my dad's side. As for my mom's side, auto-immune disease run in her side of the family. I was diagnosed with diabetes a little over a year ago now. I seem to get everything from both sides of my family in a bad way... Nothing bad happens to my brother, and I'm resentful of that. It makes me hate him, makes me wish something bad would happen to him just for once. I often think about blinding him, poking my fingers in his eyes one day so he can have a feel for a disability. I don't get how my brother can live like a sloth. Everytime I walk past his room, I see piles of dishes and old, rotting food just sitting there. He leaves dishes out on the couch for someone to clean up after he's finished watching TV, too. It's never my mom, of course. It's always me picking up after these children I live with. My mom says she's too tired to clean after work, yet she always talks about how much she loves her job. I asked her to take the trash out once, and she told me she wasn't my fucking maid. How mature. I asked a simple question, only for her to curse at me. It makes me sad. While I can say for certain my parents both prefer me, it feels like my brother has no consequences. Earlier this week, my brother punched someone in his class in the head, tackled them, and threw a heavy math book at him. He didn't get a detention or anything like that. When he came home, his best friend had blocked him on Snapchat because he had scared her, which made him very angry. I was preparing to take my dog for a walk, when I heard him yell ""I hate everything"". He threw his phone at the wall with such force, that it put a whole in the wall. He then ran out of the house. I was sure my mom would punish him, but she instead hugged him without any punishment. He punches things a lot. He punched so many holes in his bed headboard from being mad at video games that he messed up his knuckles permanently. He struggles to play guitar now because of it. He eats all the food in the house, too, yet never gains any weight. He doesn't even work out! Yet I struggle with my weight a lot, panicking after seeing the one pound I've gained on the scale. I check my weight about 3-5 times a day, making sure I haven't gained anything, and purging what I have eaten if I gained weight. This of course messes with my blood sugar as a diabetic, and the doctors have threatened to make me come in to see this doctor I don't like every single week. They also are threatening to take away my autonomy, letting my mom do injections for me, which hurts more in my opinion. In the past three days, my mom has picked up two loafs of bread from the store, because he eats eight slices a day. Eight. It drives me crazy seeing how much he eats, and expects someone to clean up after him like an infant. He acts no different from when he was five years old. Today, we got into a petty argument, which made me decide to write this out. My mom buys soda for us often, but buys me the sugar free versions so I don't have to take insulin. This week, I got diet Fanta, which my brother claims he hates. However, when I was making myself breakfast for lunch, I noticed the last can was missing. I asked my brother about it, and he held up the can of Fanta he was currently drinking, a sheepish smile on his face. I knew it was immature, but I immediately began to curse him out. He had Pepsi and mountain dew sitting in the corner, yet decided to grab my sugar free drink, which he claims he doesn't like? He then got up, and poured the can away in front of me, smiling. It was still almost completely full, too. He then decided to begin making hot chocolate. I felt the urge to throw the boiling drink in his face and smash the glass over his head. I just wanted to see him bleed. I'm ashamed of how I acted over a drink, but he's done this before. We keep snacks for my low blood sugar, and my dad had just picked them up for me. It was a fifteen pack of chips, and five boxes of peanut butter bars. I came into his room one day, and saw the fives boxes and empty pack of fifteen chips in his room. I hadn't had the chance to eat a single snack as we had bought them that day. I don't understand why he hates me, but my parents take his side all the time. He'll be rude to me, so I'll instinctively react rudely to him. My parents will tell me to stop having an attitude, and that I'm purposely provoking him. I've struggled with self-harm and suicide a lot, and part of the reason is my brother. He'll make fun of me for it, too, and make comments on my eating disorder. A lot of the time at night, I will think about how I'm going to murder him, and how I could potentially get away with it. I used to think about running away all the time, but that dream has been shattered after my diabetes. I'd last a week at most, but even then, I'd be too ill to move around much without my insulin. I often feel I have nothing else to live for. I've told my mom about how much I hate my brother, but she told me I need to be nicer and that I need to find Jesus. My mom's whole family have been Christians, and she's been forcing me to go to church, youth group, and bible study since I was a toddler. I've told her how much I hate it, but she makes me read books about Jesus, saying I need to find him or I'll end up in Hell eternally. Yesterday, we had a discussion in the car about Jesus after I had an argument with her about going to youth group. I hate it. People from my class are there, and the pastors are my teachers. They're all so noisy, and it drives me insane. I become so tired after school, and the last thing I want to do is see my classmates for an extra two hours at night when I want to relax. I have a schedule, take my background insulin at 19:00, then take a shower and settle down for the night. I leave for youth group at 18:00, and come back at 20:00. When my schedule is thrown off, it makes me want to cry and forget about taking a shower and my insulin for the night. My mom tells me that God is the only god, and every religion is fake. I think that's a very small-minded thing to say... She says I'm a miracle child from God, and that Jesus has a purpose for me. My mom was told she'd never have kids, but had my brother. She was only five different types of birth control after, and yet I was still born. If God had a purpose for me, why did he curse me to this family, this life, this illness? I want to harm my brother, and don't know what to do. I fear that I'll act on these thoughts one day, and harm or kill him. I'm scared that what my mom says is true, that I'm going to go to Hell. I go to therapy, and have before, yet I don't feel as connected with my new one than my previous one(s). She once asked me if I thought about harming people, and I said I wanted to harm my brother. She laughed. Nobody is listening to me, and I don't know what to do. I'm only thirteen, and I want to kill my brother and sometimes my mother, but I'm scared to tell people about it. Why am I having these thoughts? Is there something wrong with me? I want to end it all, but there's nowhere I can do it quickly. No railroads or bridges/cliffs in this shitty town. I'm even starting to resent my own pets. I have a dog, and I cat I've had since kindergarten. I love animals a lot, but when my cat wakes me up early and begins to bite and yowl at me, I want to harm her too... I sometimes pet her harshly (not enough to harm her), but enough to release my anger. I want to harm all these people I love, but at the same time, cannot fathom actually doing something to them in the moment. If something did actually happen to them, whether by my hand or not, I don't think I'd feel remorseful afterwards. I just want out, but I'm imprisoned wherever I go.",9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i661o8/i_want_to_harm_my_brother_help/,OkGarage5152,1737419987.0,mentalillness
2574,I Am Cursed To A Life Of Misery And The Curse Rubs Off On All Those Close To Me,"Don't believe me?

I was born early due to a silent placental abruptly nearly killing my mother and myself. My first tears were of blood. I wasn't supposed to survive, and because I did I think that is why I am cursed. 

My father became permanently disabled due to a car accident a couple of years after my birth. This caused him to be the Stay At Home Parent and my mother to work 1 to 2 jobs to keep us above water. He didn't have to be permanently disabled he just gave up. He had a failed spinal fusion that caused pain, but he ciuld have fought. But I believe his PTSD from being a war veteran made it impossible, plus my ""curse"". He neglected me my entire childhood, instead playing video games for 10 to 12 hours a day. I wasn't enough to even has his attention. We moved into my grandfather's house as well because my dad's disability check and my mom's work check wasn't enough. My mother wanted to be a SAHM so badly but couldn't, and instead now had to work 8 to 9 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week, and do all the cooking and cleaning because of my father's laziness. This left her no time to spend with me. I would sob when she would leave for work, I couldn't take it. My grandfather did not like children and made this well known, also ignoring me or outright verbally tearing me down.

Him not paying attention helped lead to the circumstanced of my CSA. My older sibling by 5 years had been exposed to pornography young and they wanted to experiment. Because we were alone all of the time while he was supposed to watch us, I was the easy target. From 3 to 10 I was abused constantly, nearly every day, and it got worse with age. 

My sibling grew to hate me, as I was the ""golden"" child. I striped for perfection, hoping if I was perfect enough it'd make my family love me. Care about me. Pay attention. My sibling's way of getting the attention we so desperately needed was to have extreme outbursts. Screaming matches between them and my father were constant. Id hide in my closet and hold my hands over my ears and oray to make it stop. In private experimentation turned to torture because they wanted to hurt me. 

I developed at first a binge eating disorder at around 8 that turned to anorexia/bulimia at around 12.

I grew insanely depressed in a love deprived household, and began talking to strangers online. I sent pictures and videos and so many times I almost met up with adults who promised to take me away. 

At school I was bullied horrendously, and each year it got worse and worse. In middle school I realized I was queer and I cut off my hair and started dressing masculine, how I always wished to. The bullying was so bad. It was like they all knew something was wrong with me. Any friends I did have I would later find out were keeping me around to make fun of me. 

I started Self Harm at 13 and it grew into an addiction

I fell in love at late 13 early 14, she was the most amazing person I had ever met. I finally felt happy, despite the struggles I had in private. She Understood me. She killed herself 2 months after I had first tried to kill myself. I fully believe I was supposed to die, not her. I cursed her. It was my fault. 

At 15 got a headache that never went away. At 16 I needed emergency brain surgery and every doctor blamed me when I didn't get better and would call me names and tell me I was faking. Later found out I have multiple rare disorders. It's been 10 years and I have been in pain every day since.

Im losing functioning of my body. I can't work.  There is no cure. No treatment. No hope. I keep needing surgery after surgery after surgery, on dozens of medications, and I spend almost every day doing NOTHING.

I can't keep friends, they always end up telling me I'm a horrible person or they've been lying and telling me whatever I want to hear this whole time or pretending to be my friend out of obligation. 

I've been SAd and harassed and abused as an adult by many. 

I am in love and engaged to the most wonderful human but I feel I've cursed him. He lost his mother to cancer, watching her deteriorate. Now the person he is in love with is deteriorating and he has to watch with no ability to help. I've trapped him. 

My parents and grandfather are still miserable, living every day exactly the same. My mother is forced to work somewhere she hates, a place that kills her inside, all for my insurance. It's my fault.

I am cursed to a life of misery. And all of those around me will suffer

2577,I want to hurt people getting attention that aren’t me and I don’t know how to handle it. ,"When I was younger I never got any attention to my mental health. Swallowed pills? Here’s a psychiatrist and a doctor to help. Cut yourself, get some stitches. I never got any remorse from my family only my dad getting mad when I tried to od or my mom saying my scars are ugly and how I’ve ruined myself. Even when I was in school going through all this it was a cover your scars (they were a year old) they are scaring teachers. If someone offered me help in college I’d find it funny that they are trying to help me and say no but feel happy someone pays attention that I’m ill.
Today my friend got very high in the middle of college and decided to hide in the cubicles of college and not talk to anyone (he was having a bad trip) and passed onto people he was just having an anxiety attack so he wouldn’t get caught. Security came up in case he hurt himself, the college councillors came up to talk to him. They even called his mom to talk to him. When he went back to lesson (everyone left when they realised he wasn’t a danger to himself) the teachers asked if he was okay and that they care about him. Everyone in his family messaged him asking if he was okay. 
I hated him. I hated him so much I hated the fact he was getting so much attention for something he didn’t even have. I hated how he was getting cared for and I never was. It was like my life all over again. I wanted to hurt him mentally or physically so he could actually be hurt and know how I felt when I had to go through my days being in pain with no one to help. 
How do I help this. I’m actually worried I’m gonna blow up in class and hurt him physically and then get backlash later from my friends ect when they don’t understand.

2578,How to tell my family I need more help?,"I'm 45F, single, empty nester.

Over the past year, my mental illnesses, along with physical issues, has caused me to do... nothing. I could count on my hands the number of showers I've had. My house is in HORRIBLE shape, to the point where I don't want anyone to come around. I barely eat or drink anything. I've become a recluse. The idea of washing dishes feels like running a marathon. I walk around my house naked because hauling myself and my laundry to the laundromat is unthinkable. 

I've been in therapy and we've been working on my meds for years. I do better for a few months, then it's like the meds quit working. 

More and more, I'm just hoping I'll die, because this isn't life.

I feel like I should probably be in a facility, because even treatment isn't helping. However, I don't even have the slightest clue how to look into that. I know my family will just tell me to shower and fix up and I'll feel better (not my first go-round trying to get them to understand.)

Any ideas about what I should do or who I should contact? I googled it, and in my area, I see residential substance abuse homes, or boys homes, or troubled youth homes, so I don't even know if we even have facilities in my state (Texas... we're not big on acknowledging mental health here.)

2580,"Psychotherapists who advise things like ""to take responsibility for your life"" should have their licenses revoked. ""Responsibility"" literally means ""blame"", as recorded in its dictionary definitions.","**Definitions of the word ""responsibility"" in dictionaries**

* [Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/responsibility): ""1. a duty to be in charge of someone or something, so that you make decisions and can be **blamed if something bad happens**"" ""2. **blame for something bad** that has happened""
* [Collins English Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/responsibility): ""If you accept responsibility for something that has happened, you agree that you were **to blame** for it or you caused it.""

* [Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/responsibility): ""1. a duty to deal with or take care of somebody/something, so that **you may be blamed** if something goes wrong"" ""2. **blame** for something bad that has happened""

It has been 13 years since I last saw my sadistic psychotherapist, but I still can’t fully recover from the things he said to me. I still get triggered when I see other therapists online spouting similar victim-blaming shit like “~~criminal~~ responsibility for your life” or “victim mentality,” even though now I work with a new psychotherapist who never says anything like that to me. I cannot put into words how disgusted I am by such phrases and how depressed I feel when I see such rhetoric coming from psychotherapists.

Some of these therapists, in addition to victim-blaming, also engage in gaslighting when they say something like ""rEsPonSibiLitY aNd bLaMe ArE diFfEreNt tHiNgS"". But this is OBJECTIVELY not true. When the meaning of a word is recorded in reputable dictionaries, we can say that the word OBJECTIVELY has that meaning. This is the meaning most people understand when they use this word.

I know there exist people who feel somehow empowered or something by phrases like ""rEsPoNsiBiLitY fOr yOuR LiFe"", but I'm sure that if there is a need to help someone feel empowered or more in control of their life, this definitely can be done without resorting to victim-blaming or legal terminology, which can have an effect opposite to empowerment or feeling more control.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i60svh/psychotherapists_who_advise_things_like_to_take/,StrikingExplorer4111,1737406490.0,mentalillness

I don't think I'm distant with my bf emotionally, but I do not enjoy sex with him and I thought I was asexual until I started having these fantasies. I'm not sure if they can be harmful or not.

2593,Traits of ASPD in me,"ASPD Traits? 

Antisocial Personality Disorder traits?

I am in need of help, I am 16 years old, and have been very convinced I have ASPD over the past 4-5 years. I am very carefree, it is impossible for me to feel joy, or genuine happiness. I don’t know why, I didn’t have an abusive upbringing, in fact, quite the opposite. I’ve been babied and spoiled by my mom my entire life, so there aren’t any red flags for that aspect of diagnosis. 

Now that I have a girlfriend, I want to be empathetic, sympathetic, and feel genuine love like most others. I just fear that it is impossible. I don’t understand why, or how, but it scares me for my future. What if I’m going to die alone, or end up hurting somebody else? I want to get a full psychological, but if I’m diagnosed then I cannot join the military. I’ll break down my thought process to give y’all a better understanding 

I do not commit crimes.
I do not harm animals/people.
I do not/haven’t wet the bed.
I do not act on impulse, I think and plan deeply.
I do not take risks that put my life in danger.
I do not easily learn from my actions.
I do not feel empathy, sympathy, or learned emotions.


I DO feel some guilt, but not for long (if I even do).
I DO lie (but wouldn’t cheat on my partner, or do a crazy lie).
I DO coordinate, plan, and think ahead.
I DO manipulate.
I DO worry this is my future.
I DO know what is right and wrong.
I DO feel emotions like anger, frustration, sadness, jealousy, and SMALL rare instances of love/happiness.

Lately, I’ve been trying my best to think about others; for instance, I’ll be out shopping, and think something like “hey, I should look for something for my mom and girlfriend,” but the cache is it’s not out of the goodness of my heart. It feels like I’m obligated to do it, it really is not genuine. It’s gotten to a point where I really don’t know what to do. I don’t think it’s right for me to drag down all my relationships by staying and hurting everyone I know. But I don’t want to lose everything.

This has been a huge burden on my mind, and continues to get worse as I display more and more symptoms. I can already see my worry about this fuck up what I have. I keep telling myself maybe I’m not, but deep down I know I am. Maybe someone who knows more can talk to me one on one and get a better understanding. I don’t know if this is a sub for diagnosing, but any advice will help. ",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i5sd0v/traits_of_aspd_in_me/,Due_Resident_730,1737386040.0,mentalillness

2605,All google is saying is oscillopsia and schizophrenia,"I normally don't post or ask reddit, and this is kind of a last resort.

       For a few days (I forgot how many, roughly a week in total), I have been feeling odd. In December of 2024, I started taking weed in edible form. It wasn't until my three or four night streak that I started seeing shadows in my periphery and around edges like doorframes. I kept taking it, and went to an air B&B for new years. That stressed me out to the point where I was seeing shadows every five seconds. The day I came back from the vacation, I felt numb. I assumed that was normal because of the experience, and felt normal for the following month.
       However, recently I started leaning more towards the idea that the actual people around me hated me with a burning passion. My thoughts centered mainly around that for a brief period until my current condition began. The paranoia started to die down and a tranquil, numb sensation (or lack there of) filled its place. I haven't used any marijuana this month at all, and only used dextromethorphan. Even then, I've only done it twice or thrice this month. Now, nothing is that pleasurable anymore. Even scrolling on TikTok and food has lost a lot of its appeal. My already bad memory has also decreased, and events that happen mere minutes ago lose their weight and become less detailed. I've become a lot more apathetic towards school, and even miss assignments past their due dates. The hallucinations have also changed, and focussing on something for a few seconds causes it to breathe or drift. Sometimes I even notice it moving without consciously inciting it. The most vivid hallucination I've had was during one night. I thought I saw a face in the window (which was not a hallucination, more of an illusion of the lighter spots outside). This state of worry caused a brief, abstract scene of many faces, an apple for some reason, a writing figure, and some other displays when I closed my eyes to go to sleep.
       In the brief moments where the apathy ends, it's one of the worst types of paranoia I've experienced. Not the panicky type that at least feels a bit pleasurable because of the adrenaline rush, but the dreadful kind that keeps me from focussing on anything else, the type I have to wait out and can't distract myself from. 
       The most peculiar feature of this mental state is the lack of non-visual hallucinations. I either very rarely experience these hallucinations, or I do not at all. The closest thing that I assumed to be an auditory hallucination that I experienced was a medium-deep, smooth sound that faded in and out twice. It did not have an identifiable source when I tried to find one. I wasn't completely lucid during this experience, though. I was coming off a nearly 200 milligram DXM trip, which was never enough to spawn original hallucinations.
       Idk what this is a sign of, and I don't feel like doing hours of blind research into whatever topic this is. Please drop your guesses, and I'll research them.",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i5d5vx/all_google_is_saying_is_oscillopsia_and/,lament387,1737331586.0,mentalillness
2606,The depression is taking over.,"I left my whole life. My parents would take something from me when I was a bad child , as a punishment. But I was a bad child if I cried, if i was mad because they were mean, when I broke something. It went from no tv to locking me up to smashing my phone to bruises on my body. If I would cry It would make them more angry. But If I get bullied on school & I did nothing... they would get angry that I didn't stand up for myself. But how could I ? If you never let me stand up for myself behind closed walls? 

Now if someone hurts me ,I will apologize. If someone is agressive the slightest I will stand up too much for myself when not needed. 

I will push people that are good to me away. I will let people in that will hurt me so damn much. It's so much easier to get traumatized & hurt again then not. Because you will be the toxic one in that story. The abused one becomes abuser for the non toxic one.

So yes... i left over & over... before even something can begin. So I wont become the abuser. So I can't get hurt by an abuser.  Good people don't deserve my toxic copings. Bad people dont deserve my last broken part of my heart. When they tell that a bpd person is the most in peace alone. I can relate to that 100%

I wanna heal so damn much. I tried I really did. But when I make some steps forward. I make +10 backwards after. There is also this little voice in the back of my head. 
: you are a lost cause. You failed as a person on earth. As family member & friend. You failed as a member of society. You cant even bring beauty or being skinny to the table. There is no point in breathing. There is no point in stealing someone's air. There is no point in wasting the time , money , future of your partner, family or friends. If you left they could meet a better partner or friend. 

I have nothing to live for, no one needs me not even myself. I'm so mad at the world but also on myself. But most of all.. I'm fine with the pain. They won... I give up. So thats where it ends right? If you put the towel in the ring?

Can't feel it until it's crushing me. Anger. Can't feel it until it's blinding me. Happiness. Can't feel it until my heart is racing and I'm scream-laughing. You get it, all in extremes

2616,"Medicated, but undiagnosed. Bipolar/audhd. Struggling lately (s/h, and emotional states mentioned)","Not sure how to start this, but lately I have been struggling with a lot of mental health facets in my life. They have mainly been affecting my relationship with my partner. I'm not going to really go into that aspect of it, but just putting it out there if it comes up again later if I change my mind writing this. 

I have been struggling with mental health most of my life, the biggest one for a while was anxiety, which was the first thing I got medicated for my freshman year of high school. Unfortunately, this led into my struggle with depression. The first medication I was put on for that depression was Zoloft. I'm sure people have heard of other people zoloft horror stories. It made me extremely depressed to the point of not just considering, but actually doing s/h. Almost immediately after that, I was taken off it after only a month, and put on Abilify. I was on abilify for about a year, but again I went off of it, mainly due to it just suppressing any emotion, even the good ones. 

This leads me into the first part of what I've been struggling with. The whole reason I switched from zoloft to abilify was due to my doctor suggesting that I didn't ned to only treat lows, but highs as well. I think the zoloft works for some people, but for those with mixed depression/bipolar depression, it can induce mania. Which is exactly what I think happened to me. It was like feeling so good I didn't want to do anything except focus on how bad I felt all the time. The abilify generally did its job, but almost a little too well. I remember my mom saying she barely saw me get excited about anything anymore, so again, switched off of abilify. Between the end of my junior year and start of my senior year, I switched to Latuda.

Latuda has seriously been an incredible amount of help, but it doesn't mean I still haven't struggled with some things. Of course winters are difficult, and I ended up adding lexapro to my list of medications to assist with general anxiety (which I am also on as needed buspar for).

I guess what I'm still having hard times with, is just constantly feeling like I'm balancing between being manic or depressed. Like lately there have been just weeks where I'm happy, then weeks where one argument with my partner or one situation has me back feeling like how I did in high school. It has made it harder to take care of myself as well. I barely brush my teeth, I can't take showers on a regular basis and instead I stretch my wash days as far out as I can and opt to take low effort baths, and I have had constant issues with my sleep schedule.

I have never been diagnosed with any sort of depression, yet my pediatrician, whom I have trust in, has medicated me for it. I trust him because so far it seems to be working. I guess I would just be wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and what you would recommend. I have thought about increasing my dose slightly, and I already regularly see a therapist.

  
The other half of what I have been trouble with is the possibility of having autism or adhd. Again, my pediatrician has me on medication, Vyvanse, for adhd, yet I have not officially been diagnosed. I do have a very obvious family history of Adhd, even though my grandma was undiagnosed, my father is undiagnosed, but they both clearly have it. My sister is at least diagnosed with it, but my other sister likes to constantly suggest she's just autistic.

On the subject of autism, I have been suspecting I have it for years. As an afab person, being confident in this has been difficult, as autism in women isnt as well understood as it is in men. I had what I would call at this point to be meltdowns, almost every day in middle school. People would make fun of me and mess with me to the point that I shut down and cried. I would get so angry that I cried. I cried literally about almost everything that went wrong. Even as far back as elementary I struggled with regulating my emotions. One time I got angry at a kid making fun of me and I kicked his desk and ran out into the hallway. I think I require certain sensory needs as well, as I love having my skullcandy crushers on with the highest bass setting, and I love having my music as loud as possible in my car, yet I go to concerts and get overwhelmed at the feeling of the music beating in my chest. I have other reasons, but one that has stuck with me even with it's harmful intent, was when a girl in highschool stopped being friends with me, and one of her reasons she was yelling at me was because, ""you can't understand simple social cues"" Those social cues I somehow couldn't pick up on, led me to believing that we were friends and she cared about me, instead she dragged me along most of senior year and dropped me once we graduated.

I have attempted to get diagnosed with autism in the past, but I eventually gave up due to it seeming to be kind of pointless. Like if I believe I do and have done research, why not just say I do? I don't really want to do that because it feels like I'm one of those 2020 tiktok kids doing it for the attention, and somehow like I would be lying. My partner is diagnosed audhd, and I feel like our experiences are somehow incredibly similar yet completely different. He is amab in comparison to my female upbringing (clarifying due to us both being trans) and I can see how differently it has affected them. 

I guess I'm also wondering if Vyvanse, or other adhd medications can help treat some aspects of autism. I feel like some things have gotten better, like having a much better time getting things done and especially focusing while driving. Yet I feel like other things haven't exactly gotten worse, just a lot more obvious.

Would people recommend I seek diagnosis for aud/hd, or even bipolar depression? I feel like it's kind of pointless to seek if I'm medicated but I feel like knowing would somehow make me feel better or at least let me know for certain, and give me more confidence while seeking resources, instead of just assuming and feeling like I'm faking.

Have other people experienced similar things while actually diagnosed with both of these? Is it some kind of unique experience or am I doomed to feel like my brain just has something wrong with it.

2618,"Recovering Opioid addict currently on Buprenorphine, but doctor gave me a small prescription of Clonazepam for my anxiety. Need some advice?","Okay, I know this is going to be a long post, but I want to be completely transparent about my circumstances so I can get the right advice or help from anyone who may have had a similar experience or has advice on how to move forward from here. I am 38 year old male who has battled addiction to opiates since I was 20 years old. I grew up with two highly dysfunctional, alcoholic, drug addicted parents that constantly Mentally and Physically abused each other in front of me. I started drinking at 13, smoking weed at 14, and tried any drug I could get my hands on from 14-20. I am grateful that I was blessed enough to never experience homelessness, I always had food in the house and utilities were never shut off so I guess you could say it was semi-stable. When I turned 20, I got a call from my mom one night telling me that her and my father were at the hospital and he had just been diagnosed with Terminal Cancer and was given about 6 months to a Year to live. Now prior to this diagnosis of his, I had experience with numerous drugs but never felt like I was addicted to anything except the weed which I smoked daily from the ages of 14-20. About a week after my father being diagnosed, I was at home (moved back in with the folks to help mom get dad to his appointments) when my mom came in one day with a huge pill bottle of OxyContin. I had no idea that these pills would end up being the reason that the next 18 years of my life would be the most exhausting, depressing, anxiety ridden 18 years of my life. We went from living in an nice home to being evicted and living in my fathers plumbing shop that he ran his plumbing business out of for 30 years prior to getting sick. The next 2 years consisted of me getting high off pills, which eventually turned to heroin addiction, and then finally ending up with my father passing away in 2011. Shortly after his passing I was arrested and charged with 2 felony assault charges for a fight I was involved in which luckily ended with me pleading out to 1 felony assault charge as long as I could complete a 3 month inpatient treatment program, which I ended up successfully completing. Unfortunately, due to the bad decisions that I proceeded to make about 6 months after getting out of the treatment program, I was back into a full fledged drug addiction. It would take me another 13 years before I realized that from 2008-2024 I had only remained sober for approximately 6-9months total with 6 months being after the first inpatient treatment program and the other 3 months being a combo or either not being able to score drugs or by force due to a variety of reasons. So with all that said, I am proud to say that on January 8th I went into a detox program for the 3rd time in the last year, and instead of leaving after 2 or 3 days like the two previous attempts, I was actually able to complete the detox program and have been clean off of all illicit street drugs and alcohol since I went into the detox on the 8th of this month. During detox I was prescribed with Gabapentin, Seroquel, Buprenorphine, Librium and 2 separate doses of Ativan because of 2 days that I was having major anxiety to the point I felt like I was having a panic attack. When I completed the detox program and came home, I told myself that I was finally going to address all of the things that I had been using the opiates to numb my brain from feeling, and that I was going to finally get my life back. So what I did was go to a local clinic that prescribes medication to recovering addicts and I got in Buprenorphine to help with my opiate addiction and cravings that may arise over the next few years of my life while I’m reintegrating into society and learning to live life without getting high and being a depressed, hopeless, lonely person. Up until about 6 years ago, I never had ANY problems with anxiety. At least I didn’t think I ever did. In retrospect, I probably have always suffered from anxiety and just used drugs to cover up the feeling whenever I did feel like I was having any sort of anxious feelings. So I finally went into the doctor and talked to him about everything I just went through over the last few weeks. Oh, one thing I forgot is that about 3 months ago I got myself a new Primary Care doctor and told him what was going on and that I needed something to help with my anxiety. We talked about things that I have tried in the past which was only Hydroxyzine which made me very sleepy, Gabapentin which made me feel super lethargic, and so he prescribed me Propranolol, which unfortunately gave me bad stomach ache and really messed with my appetite. So yesterday, I had an appointment scheduled with him to talk about getting my Buprenorphine from him instead of having to go to the local clinic that I have been going to since this past Monday to get my Buprenorphine. He said that he would be happy to prescribe me with the Buprenorphine, but had a different option that he wanted me to consider which is called Sublocade. What Sublocade does is gives you a full month of Buprenorphine in your system through a 1 time monthly IV injection, and essentially makes it to where you don’t have to worry about taking a pill or multiple pills a day or have to go to a place like the clinic I have been going to everyday and you just take a shot once a month and you are good to go. I told him I’m open to this but I wanted to think about it a little more. He said that was completely fine and said he’d schedule me an appointment for next Thursday to take the shot, and then follow up  2 weeks after that to see how I was doing with the shot. Now I know that some people are probably wondering when the Clonazepam concern or questions come into the picture and that is right now. So I let the doctor know how my anxiety has been affecting me lately with all of this new medication and obligations that I have and everything that I’m trying to do to change my life for the better. I let him know about the Propranolol not working out and mentioned that back in the day I had a psychiatrist that I was working with that said from what I was describing to him and with my history that he was going to try me on a low dose of Clonazepam, but I never followed through with getting the script. So the doctor tells me that he is going to prescribe me 15 0.5mg pills of Clonazepam and that they should last me for 1 month. I am very confused about this though because he also tells me that I can take them as needed or take 1 pill up to 3 times a day for any anxiety. Well I have never had any experience with this type of medication, but yesterday when I left the pharmacy and picked up the prescription, I had to go to the clinic to get my Buprenorphine and when I got there it was crowded with people and it sent me into a huge panic attack and so I took 1 of the Clonazepam and within 5-10 mins I felt almost completely relieved of any anxiety that I was feeling. So my question is, since he said that 15 pills was supposed to last me 30 days, but then tells me that I can take them up to 3 times a day at a dose of 0.5mg, is there a right or wrong way to handle this situation? Because with me being in recovery I am not looking to abuse any kind of medication, but I really feel like this is the kind of anxiety relief that I’ve been searching for for years and just never had the opportunity to try this medication. I just want to know how to approach this situation because part of me wants to tell him that I want to stay with this medicine, but I feel like with everything I am going to be going through over the next year, and all the things I have to catch up on in life and situations I’m going to be facing, I feel like having more of this medication than just the 15 pills a month he had given me will be beneficial and possibly help me from a relapse if things get too tough and I end up having more panic attacks and need to actually take a few of these pills daily. I know I just spilled my whole life story but I just hope someone can please help guide me from here or give me more information so I can assess my situation better and I know how to approach this moving forward. Thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to read all of this and offer me advice or anything that may be helpful. I am so grateful for anyone who has a response for me and may be able to help. God bless and I wish the best to everyone out there who may be struggling like I am right now.

I didn’t really notice how bad it was getting until today where I found myself unable to enjoy anything. I find myself unable to enjoy anything because I get caught up in asking “why? What’s the point? What does it matter if I do this or that? 

This isn’t to say “what’s the point?” In a depressive connotation. I don’t ask “what’s the point?” Because I would rather rot. I’m frantically asking “what’s the point?” in a desperate attempt to find meaning. I want an answer. I want to know why because I’m horrified by the idea that there may not be any. I’m not sad, I’m scared. I’m not depressed, I’m horrified. I want to be able to enjoy stuff. I want to be able to find peace. But now, when left alone with my mind I can’t stop it from searching for any kind of reason for anything at all. 

I sat down and wrote all this out and realized that I’m not ever sure exactly what it is I want. I’m not sure what the answer I need or want would really look like. 

I used to be at peace with the idea that life in and of itself was meaningless, and so we as concious beings have the privilege to assign the meaning that we wanted. So I had decided that the point was to enjoy it. That’s it. Simple as. 

But I’ve stopped enjoying it and I’m not sure how to enjoy it again.

2623,Should I seek hospitalization?,"I'm looking for advice, anything really. End of my rope here. (TW Suicidal Thoughts)

I'll be honest. I want to kill myself. It feels like the only option. My mental health has been in shambles for well over a decade now. I have God knows what's wrong with me, and itself regularly harming my relationships. Last night, my one light in the darkness, my girlfriend, left me. She cited the problems being that constantly need reassurance. That constantly seek out sexual gratification to give myself dopamine after an episode. She felt like didn't care. Like didn't love her. Told me that she was angry with me. That she put her own mental health down to try and help me, the very thing left my ex for. All this feels like is further assurances should close back up. She got me to open up, assured me that it would help, that it's the first steps to recovery, but all it did was push her away. Like it always does to everyone. I'm tired of it, and it feels like now more than ever dont have any options. 

Work feels insurmountable, and I'm starting a new job. One that requires me to speak to people and be positive. can't do that. With her, maybe. But not anymore. I'm a disgusting, grotesque monster. My physical health is almost as bad as my mental, and feel like don't have any more choices besides being drugged up beyond consciousness, so that maybe my crumbling life doesn't bother me anymore, or to just die. I've found myself looking up tall buildings to jump off more than 5 times in the last 24 hours, and constantly trying to find ANYTHING to get some help. But nothing. I'm utterly alone in this, and my family would probably just tell me I'm being stupid, like they classically have. Even then, the support I do have from friends who haven't left feels hollow. It feels empty. It feels meaningless. I want it to help so desperately, but it hits like a blast of warm air. 

What happens when I'm hospitalized? If tell my therapist this Monday everything, just really open the floodgates, that's what will happen, to my understanding. Shouldl do it? Should I not?

2628,Sertraline tapering after long term toxic dose and Serotonin Syndrome ,"I was on 300 mg of Sertraline accidentally/ by misunderstanding. That is a toxic dose and I was meant to be on 150. It was for a 4 month period and I had serotonin syndrome. As soon as I figured it out, the doctor gave me a tapering routine. My question is if anyone else has experience with this- specifically with tapering a toxic dose.

 My body hated every pill I swallowed but I had to take more to taper down- I assume because otherwise withdrawal could be harder than facing serotonin syndrome. It was an awful bind to be in. Three months later I am fully off which is pretty fast as I understand. So now at 3 weeks of no meds, I think I only have the withdrawal symptoms remaining although my body still feels like a detox is needed. Any detox advice and symptom support advice is welcome.

I'm reaching out her in part because I've had to be my own advocate, as we all do, in the medical system. Here is background: I had told several medical professionals my symptoms and no one had suspected the Sertraline. The naturopath/allergist and cognital behavioral therapists thought it sounded like perimenopause syndrome (headaches, sleepless, irritability, aches). My primary care wasn't available for months and when she left for another job her replacement switched my pills from to 50 mg to 100 mg size, unbeknownst to me. I thought they just looked different bc I had to switch to generic on GoodRx to rising costs. Now I know to look more carefully. My new primary care that I switched to is much more carefull and cleaned up the confusing directions. It all started with postpartum depression and anxiety. I think the meds helped when I needed it but I will warn friends about going on doses higher than 75mg since it feels like you experience all unresolved issues stored in your muscle memory as you go off it.

Things that helped me that I recommend to others to look into who needing hope: exercise, somatic therapy, weekly IV for 3 weeks of Myers Vit B w/ Glutathione (for fatigue, pains, and liver support), ""empowered relief"" meditation offered by my PT for pain and anxiety management (free app), massage appointments, and a non-judgmental community with patience. Things I think may be helping: epsom salt baths, charcoal pills, fiber and plenty of water. I know I am super lucky to have these resources. I also have gone into a mass of debt x5 but it's worth it. I haven't really liked living or any people during this but having my kiddo as motivation is helping me ride it out.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i4b749/sertraline_tapering_after_long_term_toxic_dose/,Leather_Reporter_714,1737217711.0,mentalillness

I'm trying not to bury my ideas again, maybe this time I won't let myself down, I'm very doubtful and afraid as always","Every atom in me is a wild sociophobe. Even from an anonymous account without my real name on Reddit, I feel deeply ashamed and find it incredibly hard to express myself.

Guys, I’ve been fighting this for over a week, barely overcoming my fear, and finally decided to share what I’ve created. To be honest, today I almost buried my idea again, as always, because of my crippling self doubt

In short, I’ve created and trained an AI agent that performs mental health screenings.

But first, some backstory, please read it, I’ll try to keep it short

Since my childhood I’ve been extremely withdrawn kid. On the one hand, I’ve always felt like there’s a strong personality inside me, but I’ve spent my entire life doubting myself and fearing society. I’ve struggled with depression and still don’t fully understand how I avoided suicide.

My childhood, by the way, was good, that’s probably what saved me. My mom loved and cared for me. There wasn’t any emotional connection with my father, and he eventually left our family. 

It shattered my confidence and social anxiety became unbearable. I couldn’t even speak to people, I can’t emphasize enough how hard was socializing. 

When I was 19 I lost 3 family members, they all passed away in very short period. Only reason I’m alive is my mother, I just couldn’t give up and hurt her after her parents and brother passed away so fast.

As an adult, I’ve had moments when I forced myself to be more open, playing the role of a confident and outgoing person. But some people could still sense my vulnerability, even when I tried to act naturally.

Drugs and alcohol were the only things that helped me feel open, but they nearly ruined my life. My willpower was completely shattered, and even now, it’s barely holding on.

I never truly escaped this state. I sleep as much as possible every day and do everything to avoid problems and reality. I can’t keep living like this anymore. These suicidal thoughts are eating me up inside.

So recently I decided to create an AI agent for mental health screening. Just trying to feel even a small sense of purpose in my life and help both myself and others

Because of my doubts, social anxiety, and lack of confidence, I nearly killed this idea like all ideas before.

2635,I had it all...,"Perhaps I am the frog that is in the water pot. You know, the one that sits on the stove and the water is slowly being heated up until it boils one day, and by the time the frog realizes it..... it's too late.
There was about 10 years, closer to 9 that were perfect. Ten years of wonder, love, excitement, hopes and dreams that still existed.  The world could have burned, and I would have been good.  Still wanted, desired, even pursued  at times, which gave confidence.    Then....the water became uncomfortable. Something clicked in my head. Like a light switch shut off. I couldn't enjoy some of the simple things that once gave contentment. Religion and relationships couldn't fill the void that was increasing. My coping mechanisms, ( only realized years later in therapy) were developing out of this new void.   Fortunately, shockingly, none of them were drug or alcohol related as many fall victim to. 
 -Next 10 years and filling my mind with self help/ disciplined work ethic made the time pass quickly.  Next 10 years- anxiety  takes over with extreme amounts of responsibility, obligations and lack of soul.
Now- currently finishing year 9 of the next 10... anxiety has turned to depression, despair, regrets and the withdrawing of what had begun as full life. No hope, no meaning, definitely no love, connection and now no finance to offset all that, which helped mask a lot of mental needs. The water is painfully hot on the stove and the fire never stops.

Other than making it past five decades, there is nothing to show , and our world swallows that up completely as a footnote  in history.   Whats left?    The dash between the beginning and ending dates, is almost complete.

I'll start by saying that my entire life has been plagued with a myriad of mental health disorders ranging from General Anxiety Disorder, Bipolar disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, ADHD, Social Anxiety, and some others that I can't be bothered to remember. At the ripe age of 18, I was emitted into a psychiatric ward because of extreme anxiety, and just last year I was emitted twice to the psyche ward because I tried to kill myself.

I've lost so many opportunities because of my unstable emotional health. I lost a decent job, and the chance with the most beautiful girl I've ever met, and because I can't socialize to save my life; I have little to no friends. The few remaining friends I have might be moving away soon, I've never felt lonelier in my life. Despite trying multiple medications, TMS and Spravto, I feel like I haven't gotten any better.

I’m also constantly reminded that if I don’t take my meds it can be catastrophic for me, but the medication isn’t going to fix everything, I also have to go to therapy. But my therapist can’t cover all the issues so I have to see another therapist for specific issues. But I also need to have follow ups to make sure my medication is working properly, and if it’s not it’s trial and error until something “works” for the time being. But I also need to make time to see friends/family so that I don’t get depressed, but I also can’t be upset around them or talk about what I’m dealing because it’s off putting, and “that’s what your therapist is for”.

2650,Anxiety? PTSD? OCD? Depression? I just don't know whats going on with me...,"Hi everyone, I need help because I can't take it anymore.

I will try to describe the roadway to my current situation. 

My father in law died due to a accident at his workplace back in June 2022 1 month before our wedding should be held off. It was terrible, I liked him a lot and the whole thing was also exhausting, we had to delay our wedding till 2023. Later in the year 2022 I sometime felt some chest pain, first I ignored it but it was allways present, I stoped smoking because I thought I don't want to catch something like cancer. The chest pain was still present, going away and coming back later.

In March 2023 I've had such intense chest pain I thought myself something is just not right, so I googled my symptoms and of course I just saw ""cancer"". This was the trigger for my first panic attack. 

2 weeks long I had symptoms, I of course went to the doctor, checked up myself, did a x-ray, and everything was fine according to the doctors. And so my symptoms were gone, at least for now. 

I forgot those symptoms, went to the gym, felt pretty good and also we were preparing for our wedding in October 2023. But in August 2023 the symptoms came back, and they were intense like never before. I had all those health anxiety symptoms which can accure: 

 - chest pain  
 - globus sensation  
 - derealisation  
 - head pain  
 - numbness  
 - feeling of passing out  
 - blurry vision  
 - sweaty hands

Maybe I missed something, but anyway you get the idea. I was in constant fear that something will happend to me, visited the doctor multiple times, but there was never found something. And to sum it all up, I also spited sometimes a little bit blood, which was came from my gums, but I thought something was with my lungs. 

Anyways our wedding came and went and everything was fine, I didn't had symptoms on our wedding but after our wedding the time until christmas was horrible, because the symptoms were so heavy and I had a constant tension. I tried everything to calm myself down with meditation, letting things be and focus on continuing my life. But the symptoms were still present. 

So I had enough and went to the CT, and to the surprise of no one, there was nothing found, my doctor gave my antidepressant Valdoxan at the same time so I had something for my condition. Yeah I could sleep better but that was all thanks to the medication, for now. The symptoms were still present and I wanted to calm myself down a bit, so I searched up a meditation video on youtube. I found a video called ""hypnosis for tension and anxiety to calm down"". I was a bit skeptical because I had no idea about hypnosis, only thing I could remember is that once as I was a kid a frined of mine told me ""you need to allow a hypnosis, or else something will get wrong with you"". 

So I listened to the hypnosis video, the guy constantly repeated some things, but most repeated phrase was ""I am calm"". I was the time during this meditation allways somehow on guard, because I did not know what all this is. So shortly before the end of the meditation I thought myself ""see, nothing went wrong"". And then it happend, the guy said at the end of the video ""you should listen to this hypnosis daily..."". At this moment I got a panic attack, I instantly deleted this video from my Youtube history. I remember my wife was next to me and said ""whats wrong you are looking like you've seen a ghost!"". Then I looked around and the thought appreared in my head ""I am calm"". I thought myself ""what was that""? And than it came, again, again again and again. I was like oh my god, I did something horrible, I will now think this thought the whole time! I felt broken, like I seriously something damaged in my brain, I started to cry and explained it all to my wife and she told me everything will be fine and you will forget about it.

The next day, when I woke up, the thought instantly appeard and was in my head like the whole time, I thought why won't this thought go away, what have I done to myself? So some days went on and the thought was a little bit washed out, I forgot about it, but also I still had those tense symptoms, mostly in my head. About 2 months later (February 2024) I was like, ok that's enough, I'm going to do a MRT scan of my head so I can be sure everything with my head is fine. So I was in the MRT scan and the same day I got the diagnosis that everything is fine in my head, even with those symptoms. I was happy, I thought great I am healthy and I can move on. I tried not to focus on my symptoms and the very next day it happend, the thought ""I am calm"" appeared again, I thought myself ""oh my god not again?? what should I do that this thought will go away and won't haunt me?"". So I went to a therapist, I told him everything what I am writing here and he was like ""this sounds like OCD"".

OCD? I thought myself ok I will do some researches because I never heard of that before. While I've done researches and my therapist has done only talk therapy and I saw like the treatment for OCD was exposition, ACT and cognitive therapy. I readed books about, tried those things like recording the thought and listen to it again, wrting my thoughts down but nothing seems to work. exposure? what should I expose my self to? To a thought which is normaly a neutral or even a positive one? Compulsions? What compulsions? 

Anyway time has passed and was there, the most sinister chapter in my life, the antidepressants showed it's side effects. I couldn't sleep anymore and I felt I was going crazy, I cried a lot, the thought haunted me and reminded me of this damn hypnosis which I have listend to. ""why did I listened to it? my life is so over"". I stopped taking the antidepressants and had withdrawal symptoms, it took about 2 month to gain a bit stability again. 

I thought myself ok I need to do something, so I found a life coach which has struggled with OCD over 20 years. I've had 3 meetings with him I learned about exposure, ACT and how thoughts work. Also that compulsions are keeping fueling the thoughts. I was allways like yeah I get the concept but what are my compulsions? what am I doing so the thoughts just randomly allway come back like 100 times a day? So a exposure was also, that I will listen to this hypnosis again and again. I noticed it, that the guy said ""you should listen to this hypnosis for 21 days straight"" and not what I understood ""for every day"". So I thought myself, ""ok I was misunderstanding that, everything is fine"" but the thoughts still came back! Also, the background music of the hypnosis is till today also something I hear in my head randomly frequently. 

So I after this I tried to accept this situation, not fighting the thoughts, not to ruminate etc. but I still have this thoughts! But at least my symptoms are meanwhile like 95% away, only sometimes i have head pain for short periods of time. 

Meanwhile I also changed my therapist, I wanted someone who has like OCD experience, so I found one. I was allways like yeah this is OCD, but I don't feel treated. So I told her my story and I said like yeah this is OCD and all, how should we treat it? She was like this is not OCD, I think you have PTSD, we will try doing EMDR with you. 

I was like ok...? I was allway on this OCD thing fixated, also I informed me so much about OCD and thought I have it so now it is apperently PTSD? 

Sadly I haven't had my first EMDR therapy sassion yet, but will get it next week. I am still daily haunted by this thought and by the background music of this video and can't get it out of my head. It is better than it was, but still at the moment where I open my eyes in the mornig the thought comes back. 

This was a long one, I wanted to share my story, maybe if some therapist can comment their thoughts on this.

2657,Could anyone help me identifying whether I need a psychiatrist?,"Before I begin this post, id like to heavily highlight that the reason I am making this post is NOT because I want someone to diagnose me, not that anyone could based off of what I'm saying right now--but I am just asking on whether I should get a psychiatrist or whether its a waste of time since my mom keeps postponing it but sometimes I feel like I'm really struggling. If it isn't please let me know or give me any advice on how I can move forward. I don't want to go to one if I'm being honest since I'm more of a type of person to keep my personal problems to myself (even this post barely has what I deal with sometimes). But yeah I am not looking for any diagnosis.  
  
I've been asking my mom for years to let me see a psychiatrist because my mental health has been really bad. It's not that I *want* to have a mental illness; I just want to understand myself better. If I do have something like autism, I’d like to know so I can access the right resources.

Here’s why I suspect I might have certain conditions:

**1. Autism**  
I struggle with eye contact—no matter the situation, I can’t maintain direct eye contact with anyone. I still enjoy playing with kids' toys and fidget toys, and I think I’ve been stimming since I was a child. I also tend to get really fixated on certain games and hobbies. While I wouldn’t say I hyperfixate to the point of losing all control (I don’t spend all my money on these interests), I do stick to specific games for long periods instead of moving from one to another.

**2. ADHD**  
In class, I can’t stay focused. Any random thought that comes into my head immediately distracts me from the lesson. For example, when I’m studying for a quiz, even something as simple as seeing an interesting tab open on my browser can sidetrack me for 20 minutes.

Once, I heard my birds chirping while I was playing a study video in my headphones. Their chirping got louder whenever the video played, so I spent 10 minutes researching why they reacted that way—even though I only had 30 minutes to study for an important quiz.

**3. OCD**  
When walking on tiled floors, I feel like I *have* to step on every tile. I get uncomfortable and upset if I don’t. It’s the same with thoughts like “Wash your hands five times, or something bad will happen to your mom.” I know there’s no logical reason to do these things, but I still feel compelled to, or I get really anxious. I’ve started to ignore these urges a bit more, but they still happen.

**4. Social Anxiety**  
I constantly feel like everyone is watching and judging me. I don’t know how to talk to people in general, and I feel like I’m being judged the moment I try. One time, I was trying to make friends with someone, and they asked to voice chat. I immediately started sweating. They’re an IRL friend who already knows what I look like and sound like, but the idea of talking to them over voice chat still made me anxious.

Interestingly, I feel more comfortable around friends with autism. I have a close friend who’s autistic, and we often play Minecraft together. Half the time, we’re completely silent, but it never feels awkward—it’s actually really comfortable. With my other friends, silence feels tense, and I feel pressured to fill it with conversation.

I’d appreciate any advice or insights about this. I hope this post isn’t embarrassing, and I’d love to hear opinions on whether these experiences align with autism, ADHD, OCD, or social anxiety (or anything else.)",1,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i3ie8i/could_anyone_help_me_identifying_whether_i_need_a/,Mqdyy,1737126461.0,mentalillness
2658,Parents of mentally ill adults?,"Just wondering if anyone here is the parent of an adult child who suffers from mental illness.

My son (31) lives with me and has been diagnosed with panic disorder. He voluntarily committed himself to a psych unit Tuesday afternoon because he hasn't been able to sleep more than a couple of hours a night due to anxiety.

2659,Any way to get in touch with my adult brother who is in the hospital?,"On Monday 1/13, my 26 YO brother checked himself into a mental hospital. He is currently living in another town for college and we don't have any friends/family there. This is the second time he has been hospitalized since October, and roughly the 5th or 6th time he has been hospitalized for mental health issues overall.

The hospital allows patients to assign codes to themselves so that loved ones can give the receptionist the corresponding code and get in touch with them. On Monday evening, my family noticed that my brother seemed to become unresponsive on his phone. I eventually called the hospital in a hail mary attempt to see if he was there, and used the same code that he had back in October.

Turns out he was there, but he was unhappy that I had called and was very agitated, which is out of character for him (he is usually extremely reserved). He was the most mentally distraught that I have ever heard him. We spoke for about 25 minutes and the conversation seemed to be going alright, but he ended up hanging up on me; it was late so I decided I'd try again in a couple days.

We are reasonably sure that as of today he is still there, but he has changed his code, so no one can get in touch with him. We're glad that as of right now he is in a place where medical professionals can keep an eye on him, but very concerned about his ability to operate independently and are unsure of how we'll know anything about his situation, when he gets discharged, etc.

My question: Is there anything at all we can do in order to reach him, or do we have no choice but to simply hope that things will be okay?

Some additional background (not sure how much will be relevant but just including for context):

* In October, he was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder
* He attempted suicide at age 18 but I believe gave up halfway through and instead requested to be hospitalized
* We grew up in a highly abusive environment with a violent alcoholic narcissist who is unfortunately very much still a part of our lives today.

2661,"An existential void in my heart. TW: Past SI+Actions, no SI rn.","TW: Non-graphic discussion of past suicidal actions. Not currently suicidal.

 -------------------------------------------------

 -------------------------------------------------

Hi. I am bipolar type II and ADHD. A year ago, I attempted suicide and shortly after, developed PTSD. 

I’m working through that last one through EMDR, and my therapist is good. I’m gaining more clarity over time, and can actually think about what happened without reliving that moment.

Ironically, it is that clarity that I now find distressing. Because:

1. That attempt was not an isolated incident, but the result of a half-decade long spiral with increasingly dangerous suicidal behaviors.
2. Before, I thought that I very well could have died. I now know that it’s worse. My death was overwhelmingly the most likely outcome,  with sheer coincidence saving me. **Medically speaking, I should be dead**.

This is bringing forth a lot of existential feelings and questions. Sometimes the world feels surreal and I feel disconnected, as if I am far away. Sometimes I feel like I am a dead man walking, living on borrowed time. Sometimes, the death I narrowly missed feels more real than the life I have right now.

Reading this back, I think I must be insane. I don’t want to die, there’s too much remaining. I want to live. But sometimes it feels like my fate is already sealed.",2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i3cjdn/an_existential_void_in_my_heart_tw_past_siactions/,StayingUp4AFeeling,1737105557.0,mentalillness

2665,Has anyone else given up on cleaning ,"So I don’t know if this is because of mental health specifically because Ive been doing really well recently, but I honestly didn’t know where else to post.

I know I’m gonna get comments telling me to “just clean” but it’s not that easy. like I said, I don’t know if this is directly related to mental health because I have been doing very well lately, maybe I just truly am lazy. I have ADHD, bipolar disorder and anxiety. I’m medicated for everything though I rarely take my morning meds, which is when I take my ADHD medication but I don’t think it would matter anyways because I was put on a way less stronger ADHD medication than the one that I was originally on for some reason.

My dad gets mad at me because I don’t clean up around the house, it’s just me and him here, and my room and bathroom are totally disasters. Infact as I was typing this post up my mom texted me asking me for something really important but the truth is I actually have no idea where it is. You can’t see the floor. Garbage everywhere. I haven’t done laundry in weeks I’m wearing my last clean pair of clothes rn. 

It’s gotten to the point where I can’t find things that I need, cloth, makeup, brand new items that I buy, and important documents. I end up stepping on things and breaking them to. 

I’ve completely given up on it because i honestly don’t know where to start. I’m not rejecting help or advice and I really don’t want it to sound like I have an “I can’t do it” attitude because I’m actually a very goal getter person and I work hard for a lot of things in my life. But advice like “just keep at it” or “do a little bit at a time” or “just start somewhere” doesn’t really seem to help and it never has because I’ve struggled with it my whole life but right now it’s truly at its worst.

She takes food out leaves it out, no focus bombards me with pointless conversations about people who I do not give a rat's a$$ about, her family mainly.

2687,Can Anxiety Make You Violent?,"When my anxiety gets bad I feel extremely frustrated and almost like I'm backed into a corner, all I want to do at the time is tear something to shreds or beat the crap out of something. I'd never actually hurt someone, but I do have a damn it doll and often start repeatedly drawing infinity eights so hard that I rip the paper apart. Often if I'm in private I'll take it out on myself by scratching, pulling hair, biting myself, hitting myself, choking myself, or I just stop breathing. Sometimes it gets so bad that I literally start twitching and convulsing on the floor like I'm having a seizure or something. I think it'd be helpful to note that I have autism and tourettes.

2688,How can a married person achieve orgasm without sadism?,"Hypothetically, there is a man. Normally, most men can orgasm by seeing their wife in a sexual way. However, this man needs three stages reached in order to orgasm:

1. He needs to view his wife.
2. He needs to hear his wife making sounds of pain and moans.
3. He needs to see (some and minimal) physical harm in her body.

He did not and does not watch pornography, but he did watch videos of women being in pain. He is now married to a woman. However, no matter what both the wife and husband try, the husband cannot orgasm because seeing his wife in a nude way does not really turn him on compared to sadism.

There is also quantum tunneling: He needs at least two stages reached in order to reach orgasm potential, even though the third stage remains unreached. For example, he watched videos of women having bodily harm without the women making any sounds. Even though there were only two stages reached, he managed to orgasm anyway, although it took much more effort.

The problem is that he can reach only one stage with his wife because bodily harm and enjoying the pain of others are not good. Reaching one stage is not really enough to achieve quantum tunneling and orgasm (or extremely hard due to long energy barrier), and both the two stages are not an option. What else can the husband try in order to achieve orgasm? What catalysts can he use in order to lower the activation energy?

2690,Violent tendencies as a child,"I am not a violent or sick individual but many things from my childhood that I've buried seem to keep resurfacing and I don't know what to do or think about it.
I am not looking for a diagnosis, but maybe an explanation. No, I don't think I can go see a therapist and no, I do not have these thoughts nor do I ever want to commit any of these actions now.

No, what I am remembering are not dreams.

When I was very young, I don't know how old, 5-8 maybe, I remember having a sleepover with my cousins. One of my cousins (very much younger maybe 2-4) was sleeping on a bed and I don't know what came over me but I tried to smother them with a pillow, I was not thinking of anything, I don't remember feeling anything. All I remember is stopping midway because he started crying and his mother was running up the stairs to him. 

A second incident I can remember is when I was a little bit older. I was friends with this little girl who was about 4-6 and I remember taking her to the back end of my neighborhood where I proceeded to tell her that her dad did not love nor care about her. I don't know why. I cared for her like a sister. But I don't know why I said that.

There are other stuff but these two have been weighing on my mind the most.

It makes me feel very heavy to write this, I don't think I am some cold sociopath or something. I can feel empathy. I've always felt incredibly guilty about this and I've carried it with me my whole life. I just don't understand why I'd behave this way. I was never chained up or starved or abused to any extremity. I just don't know what to do about this

2691,I don't know how to face my family and friends anymore,"Hi, I'm currently an international student in Canada. I have been studying abroad in Canada since 11th grade, which is more than a year ago. I have relatives here but they have their own jobs and lives, so I had to move out on my own. I cherish the dream of entering and studying at a university. 

Around the second semester of last year (Gr11), I had some physical and mental health problems. I had to go to the ER by myself one night, because I was having trouble breathing and had a bad cold and fever. That's why I skipped class quite often. The problem of missing school continues until this year. The school has invited me many times to their office to have a talk. I also told them that I had health problems and needed help from the school. They gave me a list of clinics that take International Student Insurance. I have tried many times to go to the clinics on that list. All the places I went to do not accept my insurance, but instead they wanted me to pay. The cost of a therapy and medical examination for me was not cheap, so I chose to refuse treatment. I have asked for help many times from the school and cousellor, but they cannot help me. 

I felt hopeless and lonely. Life in Canada is very slow, causing people to become lazy, lonely or depressed. I used to have many friends at school. But because I missed so much school, so when I went back to school after awhile, I felt like everyone was avoiding me. I feel like the teachers are also not comfortable having a student like me. About 2 or 3 days ago, I received an email from my counsellor about me being withdrawn from 2 classes (I have 3 classes this semester). Even though I missed school a lot, my grades were always quite high (around 70-90%). I always relied on that to avoid going to school. Right now I don't know what to do. I'm very scared and confused about having to go back to school and facing that again. I'm afraid that I don't have enough credits to apply to University. I was afraid that my mother would be disappointed, afraid that my friends would also be disappointed in our promises to graduate together and go to University together. And the most important thing is that I will be sent back to my country for violating the regulations of an international student. 

Previously, the school board warned me about that. They said that if I cannot regain my mental to a normal state (whether I went to psychological treatment or not), they would force me to drop out of school and return home for treatment. I am very afraid of having to return to my country, because I have very bad relationships with my relatives and family. I'm afraid they will criticize me. Now I don't know what to do anymore? Will this be the end for me?",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i2e8qf/i_dont_know_how_to_face_my_family_and_friends/,Fragrant-Mess7829,1736993198.0,mentalillness
2692,Trouble feeling love and attachment? ,"Like the title says I have issues with feeling genuine love and attachment to other people. I was abused physically (not sexually), emotionally and verbally from the age of 6 to 20. I know when people love me they will say so and do kind things and I accept that they love me from a logical standpoint but I don't typically feel loved by them usually.

 I have trouble making lasting  connections with people, I've had people say I am their best friend or talk about how close they feel to me but I don't get it there is some kind of disconnect. I feel very badly because these friends will say they love me and talk about being close but I could stop talking to them today and it would make no difference to me other than being sad that I hurt their feelings. 

I only recently started feeling any sort of love from my parents and I'm in my 30s. Growing up I'm not sure if I loved my family or if I was just scared of change and making it work so that I would continue to be accepted. I do genuinely love my husband, he's one of the first people where I very clearly felt connection like someone accepted me for who I was and that he loved me. 
So I am capable of feeling but why is it so scarce? All of my friends are through my husband and while I have grown fond of one or two I still wouldn't say I feel close or connected. I used to have a best friend who was like me she had trouble making friends and was quiet, shy and liked a lot of the stuff I liked I started to feel a real connection with her but she moved a few states over and we both knew our friendship was done at that point due to distance and how we both are. 

I've always felt like I was abnormal or something was wrong with me, I remember being 7 and on the playground just walking laps and feeling so depressed and alone and that feeling continued into my adulthood. My depression has been in remission for a few years now but could me being depressed from such a young age have hindered my ability to feel these emotions like a regulated person? 

I feel like a monster sometimes, those who know me call me warm, kind and motherly but I feel like I've tricked them. I do enjoy being needed and I like making sure all my guests are cared for and accommodated but I feel like that springs more from my pride in being a good host and anxiety that they will dislike me. I feel like I wear this mask in social settings where I happily take place in all the small talk and actively listen and engage with others but in my head I don't want to do it, small talk is annoying, I get bored with conversations, and people make me tense and frustrated for the most part. 

Like I said with my husband and maybe 3 others there is an exception. 

Does anyone else feel like this, am I just abnormal or is this something I can fix?

2693,"just found out this isn’t ‘normal’ anxiety thoughts/feelings, need help.","I (F18) have experienced intense intrusive thoughts, paranoia, and hallucinations since I was 15.

for that entire time I have equated it to terrible anxiety, so never brought up specific thoughts/symptoms to anyone, I thought it was just a manifestation of anxiety so worked on anxiety as a broad thought instead and thought it was normal as it was my normal.

recently, as in yesterday I brought it up to my therapist casually, and asked her for advice on how to cope with it. she raised an eyebrow and asked me to explain more, so I did.

after about 35 minutes of me insisting that it was just anxiety, she finally got me to listen enough for her to say these are psychotic symptoms, now I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow. I’m scared. 

I’m diagnosed with anxiety as that’s all I’ve ever expressed, I’m not comfortable with it being anything else. I know it’s a label and shouldn’t matter, but it does to me.

I wouldn't tell anything to the people helping me because that would be unprofessional and would turn it into an unhealthy relationship. I don't tell my parents anything because they refuse to understand mental illness.


 I'm afraid of doing anything to help myself, but I don't know how long I can keep going. I don't want to die, I don't want to be where I'm at right now. I'm forcing myself to go to a workshop that treats me and other people like a child for being neurodivergent. Because my parents want me to be more social and think I won't be severely depressed after making friends. I feel like I'm trapped in everything I do even when I'm 22 years old because I'm afraid of conflict and change.

2697,I tested 'Cures' for Depression & rated them - Depression tips ranked!,"So, I’ve heard a ton of advice floating around on how to fight depression, and, like many of you, I decided to try as many of them as I could. Some worked, some didn’t, and a lot of it just made me question if I was doing it right. But if something works for you, that’s amazing! I’d love to hear about your experiences and discuss what’s helped or not helped in the comments. Here’s my take on some of the common advice I’ve come across:

**Going to the gym:** This is probably one of the most common pieces of advice you’ll hear. I’ve been hitting the gym, and yeah, seeing your body change can boost your mood. That post-workout serotonin hit when I’m walking home? Chef’s kiss. But let’s be real: getting myself to the gym in the first place is a whole battle. Working out is hard, and I’ll be honest, I half-ass it most of the time.  
The best part is when you finish it. Plus, progress is so slow, and sometimes that little voice in my head is like, “Why even bother? None of this matters anyway.” If you’re thinking about trying the gym route, I’d suggest looking into group workouts or classes, or even getting a personal trainer to give you more structure.  
**Rating: 6/10**

**Getting myself out there:** As an introvert, this one’s tough. Saying yes when someone invites me out feels like too much efort, but I try not to say no too often. Sometimes it helps: spending time with someone I’m close to can genuinely lift my mood, especially if we’re doing something fun. But if I’m being honest, a lot of the time it feels… hollow?  
Like I’m just going through the motions because I know I’m *supposed* to. And when I don’t even enjoy the activity, it can send me spiraling even worse. It’s like, “Why did I bother? Now I feel like crap *and* drained and I wasted money”. Then there’s the overthinking afterward. I’ll replay every little thing I said and obsess over whether I annoyed my friends or was awkward. Cue the cringe loop and feeling even worse about myself.  
**Rating 5/10**

**Getting into a romantic relationship:** Unfortunately, this one works. And I’m really sorry if you haven’t found your person yet—it’s tough out there. It took me nearly a decade to find someone, so I get it. At the beginning, you’re filled with all these feel-good chemicals, and it honestly feels amazing. But as a depressed person, that little pessimistic voice never really shuts up. It’s constantly whispering about how they’ll eventually figure out you’re awful and leave. Plus, you can feel terrible, like you’re dragging them down with you.  
So yeah, I’d recommend it if the opportunity comes along, but fair warning: it’s not a magic fix. It can be agonizing at times because deep down, you might not feel lovable, no matter how much they care and sabotage the relationship.  
**Rating 8/10**

**Getting into therapy:** Unfortunately, this one doesn’t work for me, and honestly, I just felt like I wasted my money. But if therapy works for you, please don’t let my experience discourage you—it’s a lifesaver for a lot of people.  
For me, though, it feels like I don’t really fit into the “boxes” that therapy often works within. I’m painfully self-aware, and sometimes I feel like the therapist’s perspective is a bit superficial. Not that I think I’m some kind of genius, but I’m very analytical, and it feels like they’re just scratching the surface. Plus, my existential fears and dread? Yeah, those aren’t getting cured by talking to someone.  
**Rating: 3/10**

**Taking antidepressants:** This one’s a bit of a mixed bag. I’ve switched meds around 5 or 6 times (lol). Most of them didn’t work for me, but there was one that did for about six months. I’ll draw from that experience. It was definitely worth it to help pull me out of a really deep slump. I honestly felt carefree for the first time in my life, which was huge. I just wish it didn’t stop working.  
That said, there’s something kind of artificial about the way it makes you feel, and sometimes I worried that I was losing my authenticity. (Not that I think depression is part of who you *really* are, but that’s a whole other topic.) Honestly, if you find something that works for you, it can be a good solution, even though it doesn’t get to the root of the problem. On the flip side, a lot of meds can come with side effects: weight gain, bloating, or losing your sex drive. But honestly, if they work for you, you might not care too much about those things.  
**Rating 6/10**

**Mindfulness and Meditation / Journaling:**  
Journaling was a lifesaver when I was a depressed teenager. Now that I’m older, even though it can still help a bit, I just don’t reach for a pen and paper in moments of distress. I end up feeling like it’s pointless, but I know I should probably push myself to do it more often.  
As for mindfulness and meditation, well, that’s tough for me. My brain just doesn’t turn off. I’d rather have it stimulated than sit in silence. I’ve seen other people benefit from it, but honestly, I can’t seem to get into it because my brain literally never shuts up. I also have this thought that it’s pointless, so I don’t really commit to it. A workaround I found is walking in nature: fresh air, light exercise, and just being surrounded by nature. That’s about as close as I can get to meditation and finding a quieter mind.  
**Rating 4/10**

Anyway, that’s my experience with these depression “cures.” It’s a journey, and I’m still figuring things out.

2699,My ex-boyfriend is really struggling and I'm not sure how to help. Advice?,"Me and my boyfriend were doing alright until about a week ago when he broke things off and insisted we couldn't talk about it and his mind couldn't be changed. We kept talking, even though we agreed on no contact, and he kept going between wanting to be my friend and wanting to date me. The emotional whiplash was too much for me and we went actually no contact for about 3 days until last night when I messaged him and asked if he was ready to talk. Long story short, it turned into him saying it had nothing to do with me and he was having a really hard time. He went on to saying things like he wasn't a person like everyone else is and everyone can tell, that he can't be helped, that he thought that he had cured himself of the way he is and now he's disappointed to find he's just the same. Of course I told him he should get real help because he can't handle this on his own and he kept insisting that therapy and meds do nothing for him. He kept telling me that I shouldn't love him because he'll only hurt me like this and he appreciates my help and my love but he wishes I could forget about him. I know a therapist has suggested that he may be bipolar a few years ago, but that's all I really know. He's the type of guy to suppress what he's going through as deep as he can until it all comes back to him like this. I'm not worried he's going to attempt suicide or anything right now, but it is something he's done before when he was in a similar mindset. Me, his mother, and his sister talked about this together because I was the only person he had told about the way he was feeling and I wanted to make sure his family was checking in on him and whatnot. He doesn't want help and he doesn't believe he can be helped at all. I can't force him to go to therapy, and I don't think it'd help with his unwilling mindset anyway. How can I help him in ways maybe he won't notice? Small things I could do for a person in this type of mindset that might get it through his head that he's worth my time and my love? Any sort of advice welcome.

TLDR; Boyfriend suddenly broke up with me and couldn't make up his mind on the type of relationship we should have, confessed a week later to being in a terrible state, feeling sub-human, and believing the way he is can never be changed. Unwilling to try therapy again. Therapists previously suspected bipolar (I don't know the specifics). How can I help him as a friend? Is there any small things I can do for him besides be there for him and wait it out?

I am taking medication and going to therapy. I even took a leave of absence from work to see if things would improve because everything became too overwhelming for me to handle.

When I returned to work, I felt like things got worse. I changed teams once because I believed everyone hated me. I kept making up stories in my head, thinking everyone secretly disliked me and that I was being ignored. I convince myself that everyone secretly hates me, that I’m being judged, and that no one thinks I’m good enough. It’s like a never-ending loop in my head, and it’s exhausting. This made it extremely hard to get along with people and complete my work on time. I decided to switch teams to start fresh, but it's happening again. I can't stop creating these stories in my head. It's affecting my performance, and now I think I will get fired.

They removed me from the projects I was working on because I never finished them. They were never good enough, and I was terrified people would think I was incompetent if I delivered something that wasn’t perfect. As a result, I ended up taking forever. I can't take it anymore. I can't continue like this. I know it's me—this is a pattern! I know I'm difficult to work with, and I hate being the problem on the team. I can’t work with anyone because I always feel like they’re looking down on me, hate me, and secretly think I’m incompetent or don’t know what I’m talking about.

English is my second language, which also plays a huge role. I often feel like people are making fun of my accent, and I convince myself they don’t understand what I’m saying. I’ve even brought it up to my managers before. I have so many regrets because I feel like I’m burning bridges.

I wish I could just press a reset button and change everything. I hope it were easy to work with me. I feel so alone and isolated. It’s so weird and sad to think that it will always be like this.

Did anyone supposed to feel better and can start go back back to your usual routine and before you can continue, something just happened, like a switch got turn off.

Then, you couldn't do anything anymore? Is this just laziness or what though? Because I believe I am lazy but I'm just emotionally dramatising everything.

How do I stop doing those things and do myself a favor instead?

I'm fine, I'm fine. But then my heart is breaking and I really want to cry. But succumb to this isn't helpful and logical anyways but I really don't know how.

After that, it was gone, then things are falling apart later on.

   To put into context, my age is 31 and I have been out of school for twelve or thirteen years due to mental illness and other triggering situations.  I had really good grades wise in highschool but I really struggled with behavioral/mental issues. I also struggled with keeping safe and supportive housing situation due to said issues.

 Fast forward to today when I just filled out an application for a behavioral health home in my town and I am also looking into starting university in the fall semester as a music (education/performance) double major and minoring in English. I'm feeling pretty pumped for the opportunities that lie ahead of me.

My mom is coming over to borrow my dryer and I dread it. We have a strained relationship and all my trust in her is gone. She's offered to help me unpack my stuff and settle in but I don't even trust her with any of my things.
We moved a lot throughout my childhood and it's always been a nightmare. When mom finally managed to buy a house, I lived out of boxes for a year because I believed mom was going to find an excuse to move again. We never moved but it still didn't fix anything. Moving on/off college campus every year didn't help either. 
I thought it'd be different moving into my own space where I finally feel at home but it isn't. I never felt settled. Never felt comfortable unpacking because it feels pointless to unpack when you're going to pack it up inevitably.

2707,I don’t know whats wrong with me…,"I was in a relationship where my partner expected me to be by their side all the time. I couldn’t talk to anyone else without them getting jealous, which was really stressful. If I sent a text that didn’t sound right, they would get upset, and I often found myself apologizing and saying “no offense” just to keep the peace. Because I had to be so careful around them, I started experiencing these intense euphoric feelings that would last about an hour. It felt amazing, but then I would swing to feeling really down, guilty, and miserable. We broke up badly eight months ago, and I still have those euphoric moments triggered by simple things like music. My behavior has become pretty dangerous; I got so angry that I punched a wall at school multiple times and even used a paperclip to hurt myself. I constantly feel guilty about everything I do and see myself as a bad person because of trauma I’ve dealt with since I was seven, especially from my time online. Sometimes, I have full-on arguments in my head with what feels like another version of me that’s unpredictable and harshly confident.

2709,mental health vent (tw: suicide),"this is a vent about the current state of the world making me want to kill myself and my intent to do so. there is a lot to unpack here, i'm sorry. i am seeing a therapist already, i feel like that's important to say too.

this mainly stems from the 2024 election results. trump winning makes me want to kill myself. i didn't at first and tried to compartmentalize it, but seeing everyone become so hopeless and depressed about has made depressed ed and hopeless about it. the thing is, i am in a very privileged position in society and won't be affected by any of it, except maybe financially if something were to happen. i won't and already can't take seeing people suffer like this, and i'd rather die so that's what i want to do. as far as action-taking, i voted and right now i have a $10 monthly donation set up to the aclu to help support people's rights.

i don't watch the news or pay attention to politics that much, put i know what my morals are and when something major happens, the news always seems to find me anyways. watching the news/paying attention to politics really triggers me and sends me into a spiral of wanting to kill myself, and i have gone as far as attempting. i voluntarily stayed at a mental hospital for 3 days after one of these.

i feel like a terrible person for wanting to put myself first and not pay attention. it's an extremely privileged thing to turn a blind eye to it when others have no choice, i get it. it's just that doing so has hurt me and i don't want to pay attention anymore, i don't want to ""wait until i'm ready to pay attention again"", i just want nothing to do with it anymore. my morals are still against oppression and everything, but i just don't want to be tuned in anymore. i'm so fucking tired.

right now, the date i picked to kill myself is january 20th, the day when trump gets inaugurated. i have no classes that day, or 3 days before that. i'm coming home from college to see my family that weekend, so it will be a good chance to see them one more time before i might go through with my plans. i love my family so much, but even that isn't enough to stop me. it feels so stupid that i'm planning on ending my perfect life over something that will barely even affect me, it's just that my brain makes me feel the same hopeless emotions as other people do.

2712,Am I paranoid or hypersensitive?,"So it's become a huge problem to the point of impacting my mental health and making me unable to function some days: I've become very fearful of losing people sometimes that I depend on for work or network, not so much because of something I'd do or say (although I try to be as careful as the next) but because of people talking shit in my back, wether it's some libel, character assassination, rumors, judgement on my character etc...

I know there's some fear of abandonment in there, also over-reliance on other's people reaction because usually it will take the form of either people unfollowing me on socials or people not answering for some period of time, which both can be dispelled and will get me reinsurance the moment I get to speak and everything is fine with them.  
  
In fact it's been sort of my thermometer to estimate if things are fine overtime, or if I will get crazy anxious. If people are responsive then there's most likely no problem, even if there's some gossiping or judgement, but I feel that the moment I don't get an answer or people do not reply to me then something -terrible- enough must have been said that they would stop. I also cultivate a notion that there's also a particular group of people in my domain, centered around a few individuals with a lot of network, that I estimate are probably trying to eliminate me socially through libel or shit-talk.

The problem being, to verify those theory or not, one would need to know exactly what is being said and ofc more forwardly the reason why some would not answer stop talking which can range from not being available, being overwhelmed, dealing with some issues, not being interested/incentivized, not liking me for any number of reason which could be linked with character, clothes, charisma, ethnic etc most of which I've learned to not care so much about...but somehow my mind will jump to the conclusion that something terrible enough was said (even tho it's false or unsubstanciated) that people would unfollow me or not answer, probably because of the larger threat it social death it could represent as we've seen these past years (and I personally witness a few times, rarely for substanciated/true reasons, mostly for BS or made-up reasons).

And being in the dark about that with this potential threat is what makes me go in overdrive, even though on one hand time has proven in some case that I was being ""paranoid"" or overestimating the reasons or character of people being more or less reactive, while a few other times there's been a pattern of always the same people being connected to the few that may not answer or stop talking...but again since I don't have enough infos my mind extrapolates in order to protect itself or identify the source.

So my question is wether there could be a good change that I'm experiencing some paranoia or psychosis, or if my intuition paired with my precocious thought leading to anticipate and extrapolate to find threat should be death with some more forward solution like investing in the silent hacking of the highly suspected people's account and gather intel which would allow me to get some answers (positive or not)?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i1pwek/am_i_paranoid_or_hypersensitive/,EdgarSpayce,1736916554.0,mentalillness
2713,"FUCK NHS TALKING THERAPIES, FUCK NHS TALKING THERAPIES, FUCK NHS TALKING THERAPIES!!!","I've been on the waitlist for my local Navigo NHS talking therapies for the past 9+ months now. Which is crazy, considering I was already getting appointments, but they just decided to kick me back onto the waitlist for no reason. No one ever explained it to me.

I was promised calls every 4 weeks to check up one me, they probably only ever called 3 times and very obviously only gave a fuck if I was going to kill myself (which was obvious in the few appointments i had too, they only care about the forms they make you fill in every time you go in), and then they had the nerve to blame me when I called them out fir never checking in on me.

I went into the actual Navigo building yesterday, and someone there said it was very unusual for someone my age to be waiting this long, as they usually try to see that young people are seen as quickly as possible. She then said that someone will contact me soon.

Today, I got a call from them, TEN MINUTES BEFORE THEY CLOSED. I couldn't answer at the time because I was walking the dog, but called back five minutes later, within opening hours. No one could be fucked to answer the phone.

And like,, I know it's not ideal to call a place five minutes before closing, but if you're gonna call me TEN MINUITES BEFORE CLOSING, why the fuck are you suddenly not at the phone FIVE MINUTES LATER.

It kinda seems like they forgot to call me and were like ""oh shit, let's call him super quick before we leave so no one can get on our ass for not doing our job.""

2716,(19M) my first time venting about my new life,"i peaked in highschool. i didnt have the greatest experience, but i made friends that i considered family. my life was great. after high school (graduated in 23) i drifted from all my friends instantly. i didnt feel terrible at first, but come early 2024, it was catching up to me. i wanted to get a job, but it took me 4 months to finally find one. then i got fired after just a month, in july. havent had a job since.

i went to college in the fall of 2023, i did ok, nearly failed a class, but college life was manageable despite having nobody. (i got the aformentioned job inbetween semesters, i had skipped the spring semester to get a job, and my second semester was over the fall of 2024) when the second semester started, i was doing great at first, grades wise. but then everything finally caught up to me in full force, and thus, i was dragged down. still no close friends. every day has been worse and worse for the last 3-4 months, and its to the point that i dont even have the energy to do my laundry anymore. my room is a mess, and i can barely convince myself to take care of myself. late into the second semester, my parents divorced, that didn't help. to make matters worse, i have zero close friends, zero friends that im even remotely close with, and so i have nowhere to vent, nobody to hear me out, nobody to empathize with.

after finding therapy has done nothing for me, i finally realized what it was that i needed. i need love, any kind will do. i want to matter to someone. right now my mom is all i have, and i struggle to communicate with her. i want my existence to mean something to someone, to become close with someone, but that's not gonna happen. im introverted to all hell, despite not wanting to be. i have a few online friends but im not comfortable sharing with them, since i usually use them as a temporary escape, to forget that i'm going insane for a little while. as of today, i spend 75% of the day in bed, because my mom can't get me the help with job hunting that i need. but as you've probably guessed, a job is lower on my priority list.

so, until my existence means something to someone, finally land a new job, and gain the impossible self confidence, i don't think i'll be escaping any time soon.

# Diagnosis of Hebephrenic Schizophrenia with Detailed Explanations

Hebephrenic schizophrenia (also known as disorganized schizophrenia) is characterized by profound disturbances in thought, behavior, and affect. The following diagnosis is based on the extensive symptoms described, which strongly indicate this subtype of schizophrenia. Diagnostic explanations are provided to clarify the mechanisms behind each symptom cluster and its implications.

# 1. Thought Disorders

* **Symptoms:**
   * “Thinking about many things at once, so I can’t think at all.”
   * Word salad: incoherent speech, often consisting of fragmented or unrelated words.
   * Alternating between overwhelming thought flow and complete mental emptiness.
   * “Terrifying thoughts shoot into my mind for no reason and won’t go away.”
   * Fragmented thoughts interrupted by external influences or internal disorganization.
   * Difficulty perceiving reality clearly (e.g., surroundings feel foggy or foreign).
* **Diagnostic Explanation:** These symptoms point to disorganized thinking, a hallmark of hebephrenic schizophrenia. The inability to form coherent thoughts and the presence of intrusive, unmanageable ideas result in significant disruptions in communication and daily functioning.

# 2. Perceptual Disturbances

* **Symptoms:**
   * Auditory hallucinations: perceiving non-existent sounds like knocking, beeping, or static noise.
   * Feeling a human presence in the dark without seeing anyone.
   * Bizarre visual perceptions (e.g., “The snow looks at me.”).
* **Diagnostic Explanation:** These symptoms reflect hallucinations and perceptual distortions typical of schizophrenia. They contribute to detachment from reality, causing distress and confusion. These disturbances are core to the diagnosis due to their impact on the individual’s sense of reality and safety.

# 3. Affective Dysregulation

* **Symptoms:**
   * Emotional numbness: inability to feel emotions such as joy or sadness.
   * Inappropriate emotional responses (e.g., laughing at sad or disturbing stories).
   * Intense guilt, particularly after actions perceived as self-serving.
   * Hopelessness and persistent low mood.
* **Diagnostic Explanation:** Affective dysregulation manifests as flat or incongruous emotions, hallmark features of hebephrenic schizophrenia. This emotional detachment severely impairs interpersonal relationships and reinforces isolation.

# 4. Disorganized Behavior

* **Symptoms:**
   * Periods of frivolous, impulsive, and reckless behavior.
   * Aimlessly wandering the city for hours.
   * Neglect of personal hygiene.
   * Repeated self-injury (e.g., biting or picking at wounds until they bleed).
   * Making animal noises, especially in social situations.
   * Withdrawal from parents and increased social isolation.
   * Indifference to daily tasks and lack of motivation.
* **Diagnostic Explanation:** Disorganized behavior, including impulsive actions, self-neglect, and self-harm, is a defining feature of hebephrenic schizophrenia. These behaviors demonstrate the breakdown of structure and purpose in daily life and reflect the disorder's pervasive impact.

# 5. Paranoid and Bizarre Beliefs

* **Symptoms:**
   * Fear of being expelled from school or work due to perceived failure.
   * Belief that others are watching, laughing at, or talking about them.
* **Diagnostic Explanation:** Paranoid thoughts are not the primary feature of hebephrenic schizophrenia but often occur as secondary symptoms. They exacerbate social withdrawal and mistrust, compounding the disorder's challenges.

# 6. Cognitive and Motor Impairments

* **Symptoms:**
   * Declining cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, concentration).
   * Motor difficulties and slowed coordination.
   * Sleep disturbances, particularly trouble falling asleep.
   * Loss of appetite and indifference toward eating.
* **Diagnostic Explanation:** These symptoms indicate general cognitive and motor decline, common in schizophrenia's progression. They significantly impact daily living and highlight the importance of early intervention.

# Additional Features

* **Symptoms:**
   * Suicidal thoughts, with an increased risk of self-harm and suicide.
   * Hopelessness and feelings of helplessness.
   * Fear that the symptoms are imagined, creating additional distress.
   * Anxiety about being expelled from school or work due to perceived incompetence.
   * Feeling observed, mocked, or laughed at by others.
   * The environment sometimes feels unfamiliar or foreign.
* **Diagnostic Explanation:** Suicidal ideation and feelings of hopelessness are critical concerns requiring immediate therapeutic attention. These symptoms intensify the emotional burden and highlight the urgency of comprehensive treatment.

# Conclusion and Diagnosis

The described symptomatology meets the diagnostic criteria for hebephrenic schizophrenia (ICD-10: F20.1). The disorder manifests across the following key domains:

1. **Thought Disorders:** Disorganized thinking and thought fragmentation.
2. **Perceptual Disturbances:** Hallucinations and perceptual distortions.
3. **Affective Dysregulation:** Emotional numbness and inappropriate affect.
4. **Disorganized Behavior:** Impulsivity, self-neglect, and social withdrawal.
5. **Cognitive and Motor Impairments:** Deterioration in cognitive functions and motor skills.",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i1g11i/i_collected_a_lot_of_my_problems_and_asked_an/,DieFlasche666,1736887584.0,mentalillness

2724,I lost my confidence as a man. ,"I haven't always been the most confident person but Idk what's been going on with me. I've never been In a relationship or have done anything with a girl and not for a lack of trying. The more I get rejected and let down the less confident i become. I'm 21 years old.

 I met this girl 6 months ago and we had a good connection then I got into a very serious and traumatic accident and snapped my arm in half. then I couldn't be there for her so she left me. We weren't dating or anything but I think it could have been much more. Oh well don't dwell on the past. 

This crushed me but I had to keep moving on. I met another girl at a university party 4 months later once I was healed enough, had the cast on and everything. She wanted to bring me back to her place, something I have never been offered. I go back to her place and I'm drunk and nervous and I couldn't get hard to have sex with her.

2727,Coping mechanisms for my friend?," hi reddit, this isn’t for me but my friend. she doesn’t have reddit and if she goes on this subreddit she most likely will read a lot of this and put herself in more mental distress than needed so i’m asking for help so i can try and help her. basically she struggles to sleep and is in constant fear of death and that her time her is pointless. she can’t fall asleep and ends up going to bed in ungodly hours of the morning and waking up at a regular time (7-10) am. she’s starting to have bad anxiety attacks as well and crying at night. today she cried before dinner. the thing is that her parents don’t believe in mental illnesses and have been teller her to get over it, snap out of it, be more grateful, and things l like that. they don’t think it’s real and won’t send her to a therapist. she told me the last time she talked to her mom abt smth like that her mom told her to stop bc she was bumming her out. i’m trying to help her but i don’t know how to give her coping mechanisms to help with what she struggles with. she’s afraid of not waking up when she goes to sleep and she just has this constant feeling of fear and uneasiness. she feels like she’s alone, she feels like she’s wasting time feeling this way, it’s a lot abt her life not meaning anything and different versions of that thought. she doesn’t know how to deal with the root of this issue. she can’t find things to do for herself without feeling crippling anxiety. she’s really overwhelmed with all of these thoughts. she expressed to me that havjng routine helps. we’re both in the same college (we’re on break and we go back next week) and she told me having her own free routine helps but being home doesn’t allow her to have that routine and not expressing how she feels freely because her parents need her to appear happy or normal. i’m going to look more into these things tonight but maybe someone who understands more and struggles with something similar can help? she can’t get professional help because it’s too expensive and her parents won’t allow it so she can’t use health insurance. she also let me write out this post so alls good. i’m also going to talk to my own therapist to see how i can help her but that’s not until next week. she also try’s to go out more but she also doesn’t have a car or can’t drive, and she lives in a bad neighborhood so walking alone isn’t the most productive.

2729,"My health struggles, what do they mean?","I know this is long and rambling at points, but I need to put this out there. And I need advice. 


My knee/leg hurts badly every day. Some days i can barely walk. I cant stand for any extended period of time. My back hurts every day, but not as bad as my knee. I get different pains everywhere randomly also, but they feel different than my leg/back pain. The pain in my knee started 3 months ago, and I've had NO RELIEF from all the doctors visits.

i feel sick frequently. Almost flu-like, and feel like i have fevers with my whole body aching.i feel bedridden, and too exhausted sometimes to even make myself a meal or shower. I sometimes do normal every day tasks, like walking around in the grocery store, or simply just walking around the house for a minute or 2. It feels like I just ran a marathon! 

I'm constantly anxious. I'm afraid to go anywhere, do anything. I fear being shamed or judged. I feel awkward in every social interaction. I don't know how to communicate effectively, and fail miserably in any kind of social gathering. Writing is my preferred way of communication, as it gives me the time I need. With verbal communication, I get panicky. i dont know what to say in the moment.  I fumble my words, mumble, and sometimes people can't even understand the words I'm saying. I have to repeat it. And then the anxious feelings erupt because now I feel like I'm strange. And i go straight to what i always do, wanting to run away/disappear. And I constantly am in a thought spiral and can't concentrate on anything except what just happened and how I'm perceived. It  creates pure panic.

I can't enjoy anything. I'm constantly worrying about something that happened in the past, whether it was 10 seconds ago or yesterday or years ago. And if I'm not worried about the past, I'm worried about the future. It makes enjoyment nearly impossible. I can't concentrate on movies, stories, etc. Thinking too much, all the time. And it never stops. I have found gaming helps to an extent. But even then, I don't find myself experiencing joy, it's just distracting from the constant pain, and that's what it serves as. A distraction from mental, physical, and emotional pain.

It feels like being constantly pushed into hell then out of it again. The feelings are abnormally intense. The misery and pain are unbearable that every single time I experience them I consider taking my life just to end the pain.

Imagine being set on fire and being unable to do anything about it but get consumed by the pain until you burn. Now imagine this happening over and over in your life. When that happens I can only gasp, cry, and often times lock myself up wanting to scream my lungs out. I want to shout for help, I want release. It hurts so terribly bad that i am willing to try anything to stop it.

Help me. It’s like the walls are caving in. No medicine is strong enough. I’m crawling in my skin. Sometimes I feel like giving up. But I just can't. It isn't in my blood

And that’s where the impulsivity comes from. We want anything that will make us feel better, anything to put the fire out.  and in my case, it’s almost always quitting. Quitting my job, my activities, cutting off ties with friends or my lover. I just want to disappear. It’s illogical and  I know it's illogical.

But how do you tell a person on fire to use logic?

The worst thing is anything trivial can trigger this. And because of this I always feel bad, because I shouldn’t be feeling this. It’s such a trivial matter so why am I acting so dramatic like the world is ending?

But there’s no control. I call it shit storms. I see it approaching and it’s huge. Probably caused by nothing. About to destroy me and everyone around me. But how do you stop storms? I see it coming, and theres nothing i can do to stop it.

It’s draining.

I’m tired. I’m always tired. Even with a lot of sleep, I still feel tired. 

I frequently have dreams. Sometimes good, but mostly bad. And frequently they consist of me being tortured, or dying. Or not being able to save someone. Or sometimes I have dreams involving the death of my child, like she's talking to me and telling me she's sad that I am sad, or that she's disappointed in me. 

I’m sick of battling my brain all the time. I can’t face the world and its struggles when I’m constantly weakened.

I always wonder how people live till they are 80. I don’t want to live that long. In fact, some days I wake up hoping it’s my last day. I’m in my 30s yet it feels like a lived for a century already.

I've considered suicide. it’s not because I am miserable in the moment, It’s because there is no end to it. How can such a wreck keep going, all while facing a storm after the other? I don’t see a way out. Therapy and meds will water down the symptoms but never kill them. And I’m too injured at this point that I can’t even take a small cut anymore.

yet, the crazy thing is when I’m happy it’s also so intense that everyone, including myself, has a hard time believing I’m sick. I’m jumpy and giggly. I love life and people. I want to spread my joy, make people laugh, say funny things. It feels like I’m flying! But I’ve gone around in circles for too long to be fooled by my temporary ecstasy.

After being thrown into hell and out of it for so long my brain goes numb to adapt. When that happens, I feel like I don’t exist. Like everything happening around me is a TV show that I’m watching through a screen. Like the voices and sounds around me are happening with a barrier. I’m alive even if I’m not feeling anything.


But at this point, I'm just drifting through life. I’ll keep taking my meds and going to doctors while waiting for the end. I want to live. I want to enjoy life. I want to be healthy. It shows that I'm fighting. If I hated life I would’ve ended it long ago.  Yet deep inside me, a very small part wants to live. And for that part I’ll keep going. Because giving up isn’t in my blood

When I feel guilt about anything, it's overwhelming.  Even if I apologize or try to come to terms with a bad action, it haunts me for longer than I feel is normal. It makes me want to vanish. And I can't blame anything or anyone else with a clear conscious. Deep inside, I know it's me that's the problem, but it feels like there's nothing i can do to prevent or resolve it. 

Im very isolated. I don’t make friends. If I go out and some people start befriending me, I usually find a way to avoid them eventually. Or i do or say something that i shouldn't, furthering embarrassment and shame.

People bring me stress. Being alone all the time makes me feel bored and empty. I am stuck between the two.

I find it difficult to work, because of the people. That has always been the biggest struggle. It's mentally exhausting constantly worrying about how I'm perceived or if I have said something wrong or interacted with someone in an awkward way.
 I feel physical pain, every day, whether its a headache, shoulders, back, legs, feet, or sometimes even my chest or arms. It is especially bad in my left knee/leg, it NEVER goes away. The back pain never goes away, but i'd say for to compare the level of pain to my knee pain, its like a 5 and the knee pain is a 9. I am constantly tired. Even with an abundance of sleep, still tired. 
Also, I feel that things are meaningless generally. I know I need money to survive but I have no desire to accumulate money and things and a house.. why? so I can live an empty, meaningless life with more expensive things? The point is, rich or poor, internally I feel the same 

Sometimes, I have angry meltdowns but the only person who will see it is my closest (only) friend and the 1 person I would trust to behave that way in front of. I feel like a cornered animal and scream and shout with rage. Most of the anger has no direction, it is just frustrated anger, triggered by intense helplessness.

It’s really bad to suffer from this, my life has been nothing but constant struggle, interspersed with some temporary successes (I wouldn’t describe it as happiness) which inevitably end up back at square one again and I am left with nothing once more. Over and over

Depression, suicidal thoughts, these are fairly routine and then it is broken up by switching into an “I don’t care” attitude/persona which alleviates those feelings, but often causes some trouble because that is when I might distance myself from others, isolate,  etc. then return to the quiet type once more and have to deal with the consequences. It takes a lot of energy to switch up. Then later I don’t care again… switching back and forth.

There’s never anything solid. Nothing is ever built and maintained. Everything is short-lived. That’s the theme of it all. It’s  like groundhog day, waking up each day and having to start all over again from nothing, and never knowing what kind of bad day is coming. i feel that nothing is really there, no foundation except a past you hate and wish wasn’t there so i pretend it isn’t and try to live in the moment, but feel empty and lost.


What sucks the most is that people forget that you’re sick. You’re just weird, dramatic, gloomy, hypersensitive, and mean. That's how I picture everyone thinks about me. I feel like i spread toxic vibes everywhere I go. Routine and normal things cause stress. Noise causes discomfort. I can no longer be around my girlfriend and her son for extended periods, because I just want to disappear. They're acting perfectly normal, but somehow it causes stress. There's no real logical reason why that I can explain. Over the years I've developed a good game face. I feel like I have to. People will judge me as being too sensitive and dramatic when I tell them I'm experiencing pain in any form.

In public, I watch others. How they carry themselves, the way they socialize and interact. The way they can carry a conversation, the way they walk, their body language. I will never be that. It makes me feel very different. It makes me feel not human. Everything comes so naturally to them, yet I am unable to act this way with any consistency. It kills my self-esteem and confidence. 

I've gone to doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, physical therapists, chiropractors. Several times. I feel like 90% of the time , I don't feel any better after a visit. Most of the time worse, because it brings feelings of helplessness.

All of these things have been with me since I was a child. It only gets worse with every passing day. I've kept quiet for the most part out of fear. Fear of what could happen, or how my family and friends could see me. I battled through it all and just chalked it up as normal stuff people experience all the time. But now I realize, it's debilitating me. It has been debilitating me. I lived through my 20s and early 30s knowing I can still physically function, so I should be alright. But now, I feel physically sick to the bone every day. What do you do when you're not healthy physically, mentally, or emotionally all simultaneously?

2731,problem with my family ,"My problem is that I’m living in the middle of contradictions and intense pressure within my family. Sometimes they treat me like I’m too young to speak up or object to anything, and other times they see me as the one responsible for everything, as if all the family’s problems have to be solved by me.

Whenever something goes wrong, even if it has nothing to do with me, I always find myself being blamed or at least expected to take responsibility and fix it. This constant blame makes me feel like I have to be perfect all the time just to avoid criticism.

On top of that, whenever I try to ask for something for myself, like going out with my friends or exercising to relieve some stress, I’m always met with rejection under the excuse that I need to focus on exams or work. Meanwhile, when someone else in the family makes mistakes, they aren’t held accountable the same way I am, and their actions are often justified by saying they’re stressed or overwhelmed.

This situation has made me lose confidence in myself. I’m not sure if I’m really the smart and successful person they used to say I was, or if they were just exaggerating, and I believed it. I also can’t seem to break out of this cycle of pressure because everything in the house is either directly or indirectly placed on my shoulders, and it’s taking a serious toll on my mental and social life.

In short, I feel trapped between responsibilities that are too big for me and a constant feeling of being undervalued, with no space to breathe or live for myself.

2735,Narcistic or NPD,"I am a 18y old man, i have divorced parents (2 years). My mom always accused my dad of being a narcicist which caused to them breaking up. Ever since age 9 my parents and sister (who didnt know what she was saying) have been telling me i am a narcisist. I agree. I am narcistic on some levels but i do miss some other aspects. Let me sum up what i feel and what i dont compared to requirements from what ive found for an npd diagnosis.

 First i have a grandiose sense of self, i feel i know i am better than those around me and continuosly prove this. Second i have fantasies of succes and power, i daydream about succes in life or about living in a different world where i hold great power. Third i have little empathy for humans, while i have more for animals. Fourth i form relationships at first on the basis of gain, this is a cycle i have seen thruout my life where i get interested and then leave 1 to 2 months later when im bored. But i do not feel the need for constant praise, since i feel that others their opinions do not matter to me. I also do not feel that others have to bend to my wishes.

I have also looked at questions often asked to determine npd in a person, those being: Do u inheritently believe some people are worth more or less than others? And the second question: Do u believe every action humans make is at the basis selfish?
My answer to both of these questions are yes.

I would say i am narcistic. I do not want to go to therapy, i just want to know if i am narcistic or have npd, since ive heard there is a difference. My emotions are always hot or cold and i get bored quickly aswell.

I’m just wondering if others actually share these symptoms, because I’ve looked everywhere and these seem like something that would be a symptom but aren’t anywhere. Another thing is that these things haven’t happened once or twice, but occur very frequently.

I originally had a bloody long paragraph but I deleted it and I’ll just bulletpoint, feel free to ask me to elaborate on any. 

1 - Sometimes I get reality mixed up my dreams, I’ll have a core memory and talk to a family member about it and I find out it never actually happened

2 - I subconsciously alter my own memories? I think so anyway. I’ll have a memory of something And then there will be one small but important thing that was never actually there when it happened. 

3 - I also have a horrible habit of lying and will even believe my own lies sometimes, i usually only realise I’m doing this because I’ll think about it more in depth and realise how unrealistic it is and that I don’t fully remember it happening 

4 - friends and relationships aren’t the same to me as they are to others, friends aren’t my “bffs” and I don’t really care that much about friends, and relationships aren’t the same either, to me a boy/girlfriend just means someone that’s abit above a friend, I wouldn’t want to actually marry them or start a family with them or even hold hands.

5 - massive germaphobe, even when I was young, when I’m eating I want to be alone and I have my own rules like I can’t go near someone who sneezed for atleast 20 minutes to be safe

6 - warning ⚠️ TW hyper sexuality?? 
I’ve always been hypersexual, but I have no desire to actually sleep around. And when I was young I would get turned on and get off to the worst things ever, gonna leave it there because idk how much I can say without getting in trouble.

2741,No amount of therapy can fix everything wrong with the world ,"I have BPD and PTSD as my primary diagnoses as well as treatment-resistant depression and adhd. 

I’m currently at an inpatient facility (for a millionth time). I have tried all the meds, all the SSRIs, SNRIs, first gen antidepressants, antipsychotics, even mood stabilizers and atypical/off-label antidepressants alongside IV Ketamine infusion therapy and electroconvulsive therapy. I have done CBT, DBT, CPT, EMDR, IFS, and eclectic/existential therapy. I think I am the % of people others refer to as those who can’t and won’t get any better. I was just looking over some of my homework and I thought, damn, 

no amount of therapy is going to dismantle late stage capitalism, stop climate change or eradicate homelessness and poverty. No amount of therapy is going to take away what happened to you or prevent it from KEEP happening to you because the world is just an all-over shitty place. And maybe, just maybe, if we all spent less time pathologizing the suffering of individuals and instead focused on addressing systems of oppression, JUST MAYBE, there would be hope. Not the blind faith that clinicians ask you to have in them “fixing you”, but genuine hope. And being told to focus on the little things?? Create meaning in what’s meaningless?? Focus on what you CAN control?? That’s unacceptable. Nothing that I CAN control could make my life worth living, but yes keep burning the world to the ground and telling us to focus on the positive.

2744,Just dropped my therapist of 4 years,"I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder by my psychiatrist last week. I thought I'd see my regular therapist until I could get into a DBT program as damage control or something. Over email they seemed supportive of the diagnosis despite spending the past 4 years trying to convince me that it's a combo of fearful avoidant attachment, relationship OCD, CPTSD, and RSD. However, we met Friday and they acted confused the entire time. They kept saying I was claiming not to have OCD, but the psychiatrist that diagnosed me literally said I had OCD too. Of course I have OCD. Relationship OCD is just not what's behind my mental health crises, splitting, abandonment issues, emotional outbursts, antagonistic behavior, etc. They also said they don't like telling people they have BPD because it's so stigmatized and people who have it get treated so poorly. However, in the same breath they said that people with BPD harm others on purpose and I only do it on accident, and if my diagnosis was true, I'd be the nicest person with BPD they've ever met. I thought I was overthinking it and my brain was playing victim, but I told my gf what was said and she said ""um what the fuck?""

I ended up writing an email last night declaring that I was quitting therapy. I mentioned how they were being stigmatizing and how I don't feel safe in therapy anymore. I also said that if they were right about me not having BPD, I still have lots of loved ones who do have BPD and they are great people and I don't appreciate hearing those things.

2745,Is this OCD/intrusive thoughts or a paraphilic disorder,"Hi everyone,

I have been diagnosed with suffering from OCD and anxiety,
but I have this other issue and I don't know if it's related to OCD.
It normally comes when the weather is cold and when I am feeling weak and when I am home alone.

I have this urge to say sexual disgusting things towards my female neighbor, she is not present, but I am imagine she's present and I start saying sexually disgusting things to her, it's like a have this urge to behave like a creep or a pervert,

Has anyone experienced this, is this OCD or should I seek help for a paraphilic disorder.

Any advice will be appreciated,

2746,I don’t know what’s wrong with me ,"For the longest time I was such a feeling and caring person. I loved everything and I felt so many things but the past few years I’ve just felt like nothing but a hollow shell of who I used to be. 
Like, here and there I get a shot of serotonin to the brain but it’s like there and then gone in what feels like an instant. I no longer feel that spark of joy when I see puppies or kittens or babies or my husband, I still love these things and people but I don’t feel that spark of joy and it makes me sad, I miss feeling like a person and not a shell. I’m diagnosed bipolar 1 and I’ve been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder as well. I haven’t been able for get treatment for my mental health in nearly 6 years.

You know how they say even people who can’t love themselves deserve love, I thought so too, but now I’m not so sure. I have such an amazingly talented and beautiful gf and it sucks because she has to endure all my self deprecating comments to myself I say so casually.

We were in an argument once (which starts of with her getting upset I did something, my brain thinks she is angry, I feel unloved, and I get angrier, she turns angry because I’m angry, we’re a screaming mess, I spiral into insanity, I start laughing, self harming myself and whispering creepy shit under my breath, in those moments I feel drunk, I don’t control what I say or do) and she says she does things to help with how insecure and low my self esteem is but nothing is working. I hate that it’s true, I feel like I don’t change, and it feels like absolute shit that my gf is on the receiving end of it all, I feel like such a horrible person. 

Even without my gf and it’s just me I lose it. I do nothing but stay in bed all day because somehow I make everything a reminder of how ugly and stupid I am. I am controlled by my mentally illness and I am tired, I make the lives of everyone around me terrible. In general I am a horrible person. I can’t afford therapy, it’s too expensive.

I also keep thinking about how to escape rooms no matter what situation it is. I can't avoid the thoughts it has a habit of triggering during math class for some reason. I jump at car alarms and any popping noises. I have to tuck pillows under my bed because they spazam from being near the hole where someone could hide.

2751,Can someone give my advice on outpatient programs?,"Hi. I am considering the option of admitting myself to an outpatient program. To be honest it would probably be better if I went inpatient as I am struggling with suicidal thoughts pretty severely, but that is not an option for me as I can not afford it and would probably lose my job if I did do that. So, I had some questions about outpatient facilities. 

First, are they worth it and do they actually help? Like what do they consist of and what do you do while you are there?

Second, can they work around my work and school schedule? I work ten to twelve hour shifts and I am about to be starting my next semester of college so I’m going to have a very busy schedule here soon. I don’t know if they can work with that or not. 

Finally, how expensive are we talking for this? I have bills that are a priority and I can’t drown myself in debt. I know at the end of the day the financial aspect is something I can worry about later as long as I get help, but I don’t want to put myself in a position that I leave struggling worse financially than I was before. 

Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

2753,"wlw, mental health","i am a teenager, and ive had this thing going with another girl my age. it started four years ago and we would hold hands, and touch innocently, and flirt constantly.
i came out the following year while she was still to herself about her sexuality. we continued being how we were, flirting and holding hands, until that year ended and she ghosted me. 
i moved schools to another closeby. a month in, i decided to move back to the school she went to. she followed me on instagram and i followed her back: i sent a message asking if she hated me and that i missed her and was wondering how things were.  feelings were reciprocated and she shared how she missed me so bad and was debating on texting me sooner. we connected again and the flirting started back up. we would call eachother babe/baby, but we did not talk or see eachother during school. long story short, i was ghosted again.
 recently, we were talking again around the end of september to the beginning of october 2024. this started because we have a mutual friend and i was calling him and he asked if he could add her to the call. so we started to all group call and play games together. eventually, she texted me privately about nothing at all, and we started calling every single day following.

last month, she asked what my feelings were towards her and i asked her the same question instead of answering. explicitly
"" Okay. Well to be completely honest I am not sure.
You make me feel good. And I like when we talk all the time. And being on the phone and stuff. And I feel like you know me the best out of anyone. I also feel like I can't know what I even want cause I barely get to see you. Like I just feel like if we could talk in person more id be a lot more clear on where I stand.”
""if I could know for sure, I could tell my mom and then if she accepts me which I think she mostly would, then we could actually be more than just friends who sometimes hold hands""

i asked if she wanted to go to the movies with me. she asked her mom, and she came out as lesbian. when i woke up the day after, she texted me
“My mom and I did talk about the gay stuff. She was fine so don't worry about that. Just said some things that put it into perspective for me. And like I really just do not know what I am or what I want and also I'm young. So I'm not labeling myself as anything. Obviously nobody really wants this for me. Makes life just a bit harder on multiple fronts, but they still love me and stuff. But I also think I should clear my head a little from it all. I want to be able to like think about this with an unclouded mind and so I think perhaps we should take a step back from each other so I can really do that”

then she told me “i dont think i ever actually liked you”.

i myself am not the most mentally stable, and mixing my messed up mind with obsession is not healthy. she knows this, so after talking about what she said to me, she asked if i was going to be okay and if i was going to do anything to myself. 

all in all, we now text sometimes; just when shes asking if im okay and when im not, shes there to talk to me about it.

i guess what im trying to get to is how can i either get over her, or try to better myself to the point i can only see her as a lesson. shes helped me get closer to God and ive been trying but i dont think im trying hard enough. i dont know what all i can do to get through this gaping hole in my life",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1i03ap6/wlw_mental_health/,Tough-Obligation6824,1736733703.0,mentalillness

2755,How to support partner?,"

My partner of 7 years, fiancé for last year, started having hallucinations about 5 months ago. Specifically he believes is being targeted by (a large network of changing players) and he audibly hears them collaborating and demeaning him (I cannot hear them sitting next to him—he also claims he knows what is going on through “remote viewing”). He has in the last month had two brief hospital stays, the last one just last week.  He is now on Seroquel and a mood stabilizer. He had been resistant to therapy and meds but is doing it at my request.  He is upset that I am not concerned that we are being surveilled.  I went with him to therapy this past week and he is being vague and not discussing all the things he discusses with me with them (I was there to observe). He is now not working and his entire existence is trying to figure out where the cameras microphones are. He spends all his time getting detectors and analyzing networks and such.  I am going through one of the most important work projects of my career while simultaneously going through menopause.  I feel extremely ill and unsupported despite reaching out to friends and therapy networks.  I know I need to put on my oxygen mask first as the saying goes, but I am at a loss trying to support him.  According to him there is no way out, no fixes. He promises me that he will not hurt himself.  I am worried how I can support him when I have so little to give due to how unwell this is making me. He says this is all part of their way to destroy him is to hurt us. But there is no evidence to support any of his fears. He listens to no one but does look at this phenomenon online and has a friend that also claims to be targeted by nefarious groups of people.

I was diagnosed last year with Bipolar I, Anxiety Disorder, Depression, ADHD, and PTSD. I’m currently only taking meds for bipolar and depression (the only ones I can really afford). All of these illnesses combined have made it really difficult for me to maintain relationships (platonic or romantic) and I feel like I don’t really know what to do.

I feel like it’s really hard for me to ask someone on a date because I have a hard time making decisions and I’m terrible with small talk. I also don’t get asked out on dates often and I now know it’s because my facial expressions make me seem unapproachable. I get really anxious in public settings and my ADHD makes it hard for me to stay focused during dates and I think it comes off as me being disinterested in the person. 

Sometimes I feel like disclosing all my disorders so that it explains my behavior, but I also feel like putting all that out there is just me raising red flags and waving them. It feels like a catch-22, and makes dating seem like it isn’t worth the effort.

I am F30 and since I was 14, I believe since my first relationship, I have had what resembles nocturnal attacks of anger, frustration and rage that I have never been able to manage.

I have spent many stays in psychiatric hospitals, started therapy with many professionals, but I have never been able to manage this. In these moments, I feel like I'm becoming a monster. I harass my partner via text, if he's not with me I can send him over 300 texts in a few days, I don't specifically say mean things to him, but I'm looking for attention at all costs. I will completely ruin the possibility of sleeping well, I could harm myself physically but that has become rarer since I was 26.

I am desperate, my psychologist, meditation, personal development, sport, eating healthily, nothing helps. I realize this, but I am overwhelmed by these emotions, this feeling of having an evil self taking control and sowing chaos.

My man is the most patient, the most understanding and the most adorable person in the world, he never judges me before during and after these moments. But I would love to offer him something else, it's difficult to have this feeling of being a monster and to tell yourself that you deserve the understanding, love and patience of the other.

My psychologist talked to me about taking antidepressants, I was diagnosed with borderline when I was very young, I don't know if it can calm these attacks

If you have any advice other than putting down your phone or taking a few deep breaths, while they're probably wise, I can't seem to control my emotions and actions during these moments..

Many times I’ve had things happening around me that apparently never happened. Such as someone talking to me, someone being around me or just actions happening in general around me. But all of those were proven to not have happened. For example; I was on a walk with my bf and I saw him trip on his steps, I wanted to catch him just to see him- standing there as if I did something weird. He told me he never tripped in the first place so I was confused. The same day I thought he was speaking to me clearly, asking me about something. When I asked him to repeat himself he told me he never said anything to begin with. I have experience with schizophrenia, I’ve had episodes before but I got medication prescribed. I first thought it could be that so when such happened I took my medication. But it didn’t stop at all? I still heard my bf talk to me while he wasnt even in the room or spend time on the computer with his headphones on. If anyone has any ideas what else it could be, I would gladly hear your ideas. Of course I will seek professional advice from a therapist as well, tho I am not able to thanks to money being tight right now.

2771,I have nowhere else to go. ,"Hi. I just want to preface this with a trigger warning for self harm and suicidal thoughts. 

I guess I just need to vent? I hope this doesn’t come off rude, but I’m not really looking to hear that I have a purpose and people love me and all of that. I just need someone, anyone to listen. 

I’m struggling very much with suicidal thoughts currently and I can’t find a reason to stay. It has recently become clear to me that my depression is just an inconvenience to those around me. I try my best to keep it to myself and just deal with it alone, but I’m getting tired. I don’t expect anyone to swoop in and save me. I just wish someone cared enough to listen or cared enough to actually show some concern. 

The one person I trusted to tell that I relapsed and started self harming again after being clean for 7 years just basically got upset because he didn’t want that on his conscience. Basically just said he was going to call an ambulance and send me off to the hospital so I wouldn’t be his problem until I reigned myself back in, but I convinced him not to and now I’m just sitting here alone with my thoughts yet again.

It’s just becoming apparent that I am truly and utterly alone. My family doesn’t care enough to even really acknowledge my existence unless it benefits them, the guy I just mentioned has made me feel worthless, I have no friends, i feel like my coworkers just tolerate me. I’m spiraling and I can’t find a reason to stay anymore.

2782,Unbearable restlessness/extreme distress in body + destructive urges in order to escape it. Occurs in the evenings and drives me MAD. genuinely mad- PLEASE give me some feedback,"Please note- mention of self harm urges !

I cannot seem to explain to therapists-  they do not understand it or the severity.
I have experienced this for years. 
I am also autistic/adhd which may have some relation- have previously struggled with severe depression but not for a while.
Okay so I have this mental/physical experience in the evenings- with the main urge to “fix”or escape it being blunt force to my head. 

-It begins with a nausea located in my head- NOT like in the stomach when you have an urge to throw up. Similar to when you’ve been on your phone for hours or tv all day in a dark room feeling. 
The nausea/queasiness creeps throughout my body. Inescapable feeling. Paired with extreme restlessness, trapped in my head feeling and irritation of surroundings and inside body. Similar to overstimulation in the body- any touch or sound is distressing. 
•A sort of severe boredom- with no “ability” to move or do anything: everything sounds unbearable to do is the best I can put it. Trapped in my body and in my head.
•My tinnitus is way more noticeable when this occurs !! Drives me insane
•Restlessness that makes me want to shred my skin off. shred. not an exaggeration. tear and tear. extremely irritated extremely distressed. near non-verbal. 
•Urge to pace but that pent up energy worsens and becomes combustive/destructive. Movement worsens this. 
Crying from frustration and fear. 
•Profound hopelessness- feeling of complete inability to handle any simple daily task or responsibility or challenge in my life. 
Noises are far more irritating.
•Incredibly distressing to be inside my body- serious urge to beat my head on the wall. 

•The only mild help is sitting very still with an ice pack so I do not hurt myself and the ice is sort of grounding. Or being smacked or compressed by a friend- 
•The urge that feels like the most helpful “fix” is self harm through cutting/blunt force- which I am trying to avoid. I have been clean for a good while and want to stay that way.
•Suggestions to get up or try a solution by others make me feel severely more distressed and combustive.
•Urge to writhe and roll and rip my hair or rip into my stomach. extreme bodily discomfort/stress. 

This is not brought on by anything as far as I can tell. Occurs off medication- I do not take any prescribed medication currently. I cannot tell if previous medication has helped with this-but Concerta definitely made it worse.

Not brought on by depression- 
• ate enough and hydrated, had a nice long walk, lots of laughing and engaging with friends. 
•It does NOT feel like a panic attack. Nor like a normal autistic/overstimulation meltdown but maybe thats really all it is??


The feeling drives me mad. I cant stress enough how severe the feeling is.
It doesn’t happen every single night- in fact it stopped for a couple months when I moved. I thought it was due to my environment before- and it was more severe back then, but now I live with wonderful safe roommates and have a very comfortable “safe space” of a room. I will have a totally normal or lovely day- and then it will set in.

Please- does this sound familiar at all. Any suggestions/fixes beside trying different therapists and meds(which I am)
Thank you<3

I (28M) have anxiety issues, and I’ve been interested in getting a firearm for protection for a while. This isn’t necessarily the only form of defense I’d implement. My girlfriend of 2 years (27F) who I share an apartment with has depression, anxiety, suicidal ideations, etc and she does not want me to get one as she fears harming herself with it and feels she would be able to access it regardless of how it is locked up/secured. She believes she would use the gun over other options because it’s the quickest and least painful way out. We haven’t been able to compromise on the issue. 

My question to you good folk is if this would be a dealbreaker for you? Would you entertain the possibility of your partner getting or keeping a gun? Am I a selfish jerk for wanting this thing that potentially threatens her life, even if my intentions are good? I haven’t done anything damning yet, I think.

2788,Living with bpd and bipolar ,"Living in a state of perpetual mental turmoil is a soul-crushing existence, a constant and exhausting battle to reign in the tempests that rage within. The relentless barrage of thoughts, emotions, and scenarios that assault your mind on a daily basis is a debilitating weight, making it a Herculean task to distinguish reality from the myriad of possibilities that your brain conjures up. The hyper-vigilance that accompanies this state of being is a double-edged sword, rendering you acutely aware of the subtleties of human interaction, yet simultaneously leaving you vulnerable to the devastating consequences of misinterpretation.

Your own mind is a merciless critic, ruthlessly excavating every insecurity, mistake, and weakness, and presenting them as irrefutable evidence of your inadequacy. The emotional pain that accompanies this self-flagellation is a palpable and overwhelming force, a maelstrom of despair and rage that threatens to consume you whole. You are unable to simply experience emotions in a nuanced and measured way; instead, you are beset by extremes of feeling, careening wildly from the depths of desperation to the heights of fury. When these emotions are directed towards those you love, you are transformed into a person you barely recognize, capable of inflicting hurt and pain with a cruelty that is both shocking and devastating.

The aftermath of these episodes is a desolate and barren landscape, a wasteland of guilt and shame that seems impossible to escape. You are left to pick up the pieces of your shattered psyche, to wonder how you could have said and done such things, and to grapple with the existential terror of losing control and succumbing to the darkness that lurks within. And yet, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, you are not defined by your mental health. You are a complex and multifaceted individual, deserving of love, compassion, and understanding. 

You are fragile, not like a delicate flower or a breakable glass doll, but like a bomb waiting to detonate, one match or spark away from exploding into a thousand pieces. Your emotions are a volatile mixture, waiting for the catalyst that will set them off, unleashing a torrent of feelings that will leave devastation in their wake. You deserve to be loved, to be happy, and to live a life that is authentic and meaningful. Nobody should have to live in fear of themselves, and nobody should have to fight against their own thoughts.",7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1hys3qa/living_with_bpd_and_bipolar/,Wild_Bass8742,1736586476.0,mentalillness

2791,Quick Rant.,"How the hell is anyone else going to know me if I have yet known myself.

A terrifying thought, what if everyone already knows who and what I am, never to be known by myself. I believe such a thing to be real sadness, heavy suffocating depression, who is that stranger in the mirror staring dead eyed into my soul. That uncomfortable gaze spearing right through, the hollowness of my being. As time went on, I became comfortable with that uncomfortableness, well honestly , I more so found distractions in escapism. Isolating myself in a shrow of artificial dopamine, testing many chemicals while rotating in sex,food,and social media. With all those in circulation, coming together it was extremely successful keeping me away from me. Or maybe my over-thinking is what's submitting me to this eternal despair. Or maybe some people are stars  created to shine, maybe some people are comets created to move fast and freely, and just maybe some people are black holes created to be void in depth. 

 If only I could see my true self as easily as I see others' true selves, I don't think I'd be writing this. So many times and with such intensity could I not only see others' true self, but I felt them. A person's mouth can say the complete opposite of what they are truly feeling, but eyes, speech pattern, vocabulary, tone, face, and body will never lie. For whatever reason my brain seems to hyper focus on those areas extensively, while being around others. Once noticing someone anxious  I begin to feel anxious myself. I'm not so much mirroring what that person feels and reflecting it back, I experience the feeling with them. When they try to hide what they are truly feeling, it's easier for me to see their true feelings. The same can be said whenever I try not to focus, my sight becomes sharper. Alcohol helps dull the view, especially in larger gatherings, but it's not a long term solution. I've made the mistake more times than I should have, using marijuana to help, backfiring everytime amplifying my sight and intensifying what I felt.  

  Many nights of sleep were lost, it still wasn't all bad though. There's definitely advantages to that hyper focus, knowing what to say to people quickly grows your favorability with them. Or knowing what infuriates a person to their core, could be valuable.

   Manipulation became second nature to me, to the point of subconsciously using tactics instinctively before ever learning them. Since a child around the age of 8-10, slowly orchestrating false narratives to my mother of getting her to believe whenever I did something I shouldn't have, I made it a point to immediately tell her. Making her  believe that when her son did something bad, the guilt would be too heavy a burden and come to confess my wrong doings. Strategically planting a thread to pull if ever really caught. No one taught me that, I never saw it done before, but I knew instinctively as a kid that would work. Since then I've only sharpened those instincts.

  I am well aware that there is something wrong with me, and it infuriates me to not understand it, or where it stems from. I hate asking for help, that actually infuriates me more than anything. I've exhausted all my options and years trying on my own, clearly something has to budge and I'll take any help I can get.

Towards the end of august, he came home from work and just refused to talk. Didn’t talk to me (I live with him), didn’t talk to his coworkers, family, friends, anyone, for about a week. I knew something was up but I wasn’t sure what. He ended up going into a psychosis, where he had some paranoia believing our apartment was bugged, that people were watching him, and then he started saying how people are trying to frame him. Both his dad and brother made the decision to call crisis on him where he was taken in to be evaluated. It was determined he had PTSD and the psychosis was due to him not sleeping for the week he wouldn’t talk.

When he went back to work, he continued to talk about situations that didn’t happen, or that he made up and still believed during his psychosis. Some days he knew it wasn’t real, others, not so much. 

Towards the end of December he started having erratic behavior that included outbursts of anger, pacing, and would start turning those psychosis thoughts into an elaborate story as if it happened. We could be sitting on the couch watching a show and he would get up and leave and not say a word about where he was going or why. He would then proceed to tell coworkers and family members I was trying to control him and where it was because I asked questions like “are you okay? Where are you going? When will you be back?”

On New Year’s Day, we went shopping at Walmart to get a few things to make dinner when he expressed he felt like he had been living in his head for 9 months and finally was free. When we got home, he told me a very elaborate story from when his psychosis happened and how he believed the apartment above us had a machine pointing towards our bedroom to brainwash him and make him go insane. He believed his job and coworkers were out to get him. After he shared this story, things got increasingly worse. He randomly packed a bag and moved out to love with his brother (he lives on the opposite side of our apartment complex so it wasn’t anything crazy), and he told his brother he wanted to be inpatient because he knew his head was feeling weird but also felt like I was trying to brain wash him. Well he stayed at his brothers for an hour before jumping in his rental and spending 4 days in Washington DC and didn’t tell anyone let alone why. Turns out he ubered home leaving his rental there, and things escalated even more. 

When he came home he said he dropped off his rental and how he was under cover and cleared everyone of their crimes… he took about 8 more Ubers from home to philly, back home, to the facility he was doing outpatient, back home, back to the facility 4 times, then an Uber to DC, stayed for less than an hour and back, etc. any time we tried getting him to relax, he’d Uber and say he was “going on a journey to clear everyone’s name”. The outpatient facility could tell he was manic and severe and he wasn’t on any antipsychotics or mood stabilizers and they were trying to get him admitted. 

Ultimately the facility rejected him and myself and his brother called crisis because when my boyfriend heard he wasn’t going, the look on his face was unrecognizable, and being in his presence made my anxiety go through the roof as this was the first time I was genuinely scared of him and the vibe he was giving. 

He was taken in for having an anxiety attack and when it was time for his psych evaluation, he didn’t speak. Ultimately they transferred him to a behavioral facility where he believes he’s getting out in a few days and says “he’s fine”. The facility that rejected him called after he was admitted and expressed they rejected him due to him having homicidal ideations towards his coworkers and had a “list”. They also expressed they saw clear indications of schizophrenia and potential bipolar disorder and were sure to inform the facility he is now at, of their findings previously. 

My boyfriend does have phone privileges and has been calling his brother and his dad (who he refused to talk to previously). I’m unsure about his mom, but he refused to talk to her previously as well. I’ve been watching the man I fell in love with change and try to get him help, where at first it was denial, then he wanted help but got rejected, and now he is in a facility to receive help and he seems to hate me for putting him in there (his dad told me he’s upset with me for getting him committed). 

I’ve never dealt with anyone with schizophrenia or manic episodes like this before, and I was hoping for some type of insight on if he will forgive me knowing this was for his safety, and unknowingly the safety of others, and for him to be on a road to recovery. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I love this man, and I don’t want him to hate me or think I wanted this, but I know he needs this.

For context, we live in south New Jersey. Washington DC is about 3 hours and some change, and philly (Philadelphia, PA) is about 45 minutes away.

2801,I am sick and tired of people pretending to have mental illness,"Yes, there. I said it. Majority of people have absolutely no or very minor mental issue but they made it out to be their entire personality and I am sick and tired of this. Bring back sentences like ""he is just weird"" and be done with it. I probably have some mild version of something... who cares? I just live my life, not bothering others with my made up personality.",0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1hyv75x/i_am_sick_and_tired_of_people_pretending_to_have/,Traditional-Cake-950,1736599768.0,mentalillness
